<h3>1</h3>

<p class="noindent">It was evening. Winter hung white over the
earth. Great snowflakes crept over the snow
towards the coach. They moved ghostlike
over the silent, treeless plain. Mountains
rose behind them in the snow. Small church
towers and roofs crowded over each other. Here
and there little squares flared up in the darkness.</p>

<p>Night fell as the coach reached the excise barrier.
Beyond, two sentry boxes buried in the
snow faced each other. The coachman shouted
between his hands. A drowsy voice answered
and white cockades began to move in the dark recesses
of the boxes. The light of a lamp emerged
from the guard’s cottage. Behind the gleam a
man with a rifle over his arm strolled towards the
vehicle.</p>

<p>The high-wheeled travelling coach was painted
in two colours: the upper part dark green, the
lower, including the wheels, bright yellow. From
near the driver’s seat small oil lamps shed their
light over the horses’ backs. The animals steamed
in the cold.</p>

<p>The guard lifted his lantern. At the touch of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
the crude light, the coach window rattled and descended.
In its empty frame appeared a powerful
grey head. Two steady cold eyes looked
into the guard’s face. The man stepped back.
He bowed respectfully.</p>

<p>“The Ulwing coach!” He drew the barrier
aside. The civil guards in the sentry boxes presented
arms.</p>

<p>“You may pass!”</p>

<p>The light of the coach’s lamps wandered over
crooked palings, over waste ground&mdash;a large deserted
market&mdash;the wall of a church. Along the
winding lanes lightless houses, squatting above
the ditches, sulked with closed eyes in the dark.
Further on the houses became higher. Not a
living thing was to be seen until near the palace
of Prince Grassalkovich a night-watchman
waded through the snow. From the end of a
stick he held in his hand dangled a lantern. The
shadow of his halberd moved on the wall like
some black beast rearing over his head.</p>

<p>From the tower of the town hall a hoarse voice
shouted into the quiet night: “Praised be the
Lord Jesus!” and higher up the watchman announced
that he was awake.</p>

<p>Then the township relapsed into silence. Snow
fell leisurely between old gabled roofs. Under
jutting eaves streets crept forth from all sides,
crooked, suspicious, like conspirators. Where
they met they formed a ramshackle square. In
the middle of the square the Servites’ Fountain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
played in front of the church; water murmured
frigidly from its spout like a voice from the dark
that prayed slowly, haltingly.</p>

<p>A solitary lamp at a corner house thrust out
from an iron bracket into the street. Whenever
it rocked at the wind’s pleasure, the chain creaked
gently and the beam of its light shrunk on the
wall till it was no bigger than a child’s fist. Another
lone lamp in the middle of New Market
Place. Its smoky light was absorbed by the falling
snow and never reached the ground.</p>

<p>Christopher Ulwing drew his head into his fur-collared
coat. The almanac proclaimed full
moon for to-night. Whenever this happened,
the civic authorities saved lamp-oil; could they
accept responsibility if the heavens failed to
comply with the calendar and left the town in
darkness? In any case, at this time of night the
only place for peaceful citizens was by their own
fireside.</p>

<p>Two lamps alight.... And even these were
superfluous.</p>

<p>Pest, the old-fashioned little town had gone
to rest and the fancy came to Christopher Ulwing
that it was asleep even in day time, and that he
was the only person in it who was ever quite
awake.</p>

<p>He raised his head; the Leopold suburb had
been reached. The carriage had come to the
end of the rough, jerky cobbles. Under the
wheels the ruts became soft and deep. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
breeze blowing from the direction of the Danube
ruffled the horses’ manes gently.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, a clear, pleasant murmur
broke the silence. The great life-giving river
pursued its mysterious course through the darkness,
invisible even as life itself.</p>

<p>Beyond it were massed the white hills of Buda.
On the Pest side an uninterrupted plain stretched
between the town and the river. In the white
waste the house of Christopher Ulwing stood
alone. For well nigh thirty years it had been
called in town “the new house.” The building
of it had been a great event. The citizens of the
Inner Town used to make excursions on Sundays
to see it. They looked at it, discussed it,
and shook their heads. They could not grasp
why Ulwing the builder should put his house
there in the sand when plenty of building ground
could be got cheaply, in the lovely narrow streets
of the Inner Town. But he would have his own
way and loved his house all the more. The child
of his mind, the product of his work, his bricks,
it was entirely his own. Though once upon a
time....</p>

<p>While Christopher Ulwing listened unconsciously
to the murmur of the Danube, silent
shades rose from afar and spoke to his soul. He
thought of the ancient Ulwings who had lived in
the great dark German forest. They were woodcutters
on the shores of the Danube and they followed
their calling downstream. Some acquired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
citizenship in a small German town. They became
master carpenters and smiths. They
worked oak and iron, simple, rude materials,
and were moulded in the image of the stuff they
worked in. Honest, strong men. Then one happened
to wander into Hungary; he settled down
in Pozsony and became apprenticed to a goldsmith.
He wrought in gold and ivory. His
hand became lighter, his eye more sensitive than
his ancestors’. He was an artist.... Christopher
Ulwing thought of him&mdash;his father. There
were two boys, he and his brother Sebastian, and
when the parental house became empty, they too
like those before them, heard the call. They left
Pozsony on the banks of the Danube. They followed
the river, orphans, poor.</p>

<p>Many a year had passed since. Many a thing
had changed.</p>

<p>Christopher Ulwing drew out his snuff box.
It was his father’s work and his only inheritance.
He tapped it lightly with two fingers. As it
sank back into his pocket, he bent towards the
window.</p>

<p>His house now became distinctly visible; the
steep double roof, the compact storied front, the
mullioned windows in the yellow wall, the door
of solid oak with its semi-circular top like a pair
of frowning eyebrows. Two urns stood above
the ends of the cornice and two caryatid pillars
flanked the door. Every recess, every protruding
wall of the house appeared soft and white.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>Indoors the coach had been noticed. The windows
of the upper story became first light and
then dark again in quick succession. Someone
was running along the rooms with a candle. The
big oak gate opened. The wheels clattered, the
travelling box was jerked against the back of
the coach and all of a sudden the caryatids&mdash;human
pillars&mdash;looked into the coach window. The
noise of the hoofs and the wheels echoed like
thunder under the archway of the porch.</p>

<p>The manservant lowered the steps of the coach.</p>

<p>A young man stood on the landing of the staircase.
He held a candle high above his head.
The light streamed over his thick fair hair. His
face was in the shade.</p>

<p>“Good evening, John Hubert!” shouted Ulwing
to his son. His voice sounded deep and
sharp, like a hammer dropping on steel. “How
are the children?” He turned quickly round.
This sudden movement flung the many capes of
his coat over his shoulders.</p>

<p>The servant’s good-natured face emerged from
the darkness.</p>

<p>“The book-keeper has been waiting for a long
time....”</p>

<p>“Is everybody asleep in this town?”</p>

<p>“Of course I am not asleep, of course I am
not&mdash;&mdash;” and there was Augustus Füger rushing
down the stairs. He was always in a hurry,
his breath came short, he held his small bald head
on one side as if he were listening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>Christopher Ulwing slapped him on the
back.</p>

<p>“Sorry, Füger. My day lasts as long as my
work.”</p>

<p>John Hubert came to meet his father. His
coat was bottle green. His waistcoat and nankin
trousers were buff. On his exaggeratedly
high collar the necktie, twisted twice round, displayed
itself in elegant folds. He bowed respectfully
and kissed his father’s hand. He resembled
him, but he was shorter, his eyes were paler
and his face softer.</p>

<p>A petticoat rustled on the square slabs of the
dark corridor behind them.</p>

<p>Christopher Ulwing did not even turn round.
“Good evening, Mamsell. I am not hungry.”
Throwing his overcoat on a chair, he went into
his room.</p>

<p>Mamsell Tini’s long, stiff face, flanked by two
hair cushions covering her ears, looked disappointedly
after the builder; she had kept his supper
in vain. She threw her key-basket from one
arm to the other and sailed angrily back into
the darkness of the corridor.</p>

<p>The room of Christopher Ulwing was low and
vaulted. White muslin curtains hung at its two
bay windows. On the round table, a candle
was burning; it was made of tallow but stood
in a silver candle-stick. Its light flickered slowly
over the checked linen covers of the spacious
armchairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>“Sit down, Füger. You, too,” said Ulwing to
his son, but remained standing himself.</p>

<p>“The Palatine has entrusted me with the repair
of the castle. I concluded the bargain
about the forest.” He took a letter up from the
table. Whatever he wanted his hand seized, his
fist grabbed, without hesitation. Meanwhile he
dictated short, precise instructions to the book-keeper.</p>

<p>Füger wrote hurriedly in his yellow-covered
note book. He always carried it about him; even
when he went to Mass it peeped out of his pocket.</p>

<p>John Hubert sat uncomfortably in the bulging
armchair. Above the sofa hung the portraits
of the architects Fischer von Erlach and Mansard,
fine old small engravings. He knew those
two faces, but took no interest in them. He began
to look at the green wall paper. Small
squares, green wreaths. He looked at each of
them separately. Meanwhile he became drowsy.
Several times he withdrew the big-headed pin
which fastened the tidy to the armchair and each
time restuck it in the same place. Then he
coughed, though he really wanted to yawn.</p>

<p>Füger was still taking notes. He only spoke
when the builder had stopped.</p>

<p>“Mr. Münster called here. His creditors are
driving him into bankruptcy.”</p>

<p>Christopher Ulwing’s look became stern.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell me that before?”</p>

<p>Füger shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>“I haven’t had a chance to put a word in....”</p>

<p>The builder stood motionless in the middle of
the room. He contracted his brows as if he were
peering into the far distance.</p>

<p>Martin George Münster, the powerful contractor,
the qualified architect, was ruined. The
last rival, the great enemy who had so many times
baulked him, counted no more. He thought of
humiliations, of breathless hard fights, and of the
many men who had had to go down that he might
rise. He had vanquished them all. Now, at
last, he was really at the top.</p>

<p>With his big fingers he gave a contented twist
to the smart white curl which he wore on the side
of his head.</p>

<p>Füger watched him attentively. Just then,
the candle lit up the builder’s bony, clean-shaven
face, tanned by the cold wind. His hair and eyebrows
seemed whiter, his eyes bluer than usual.
His chin, turned slightly to one side and drawn
tightly into an open white collar, gave him a peculiar,
obstinate expression.</p>

<p>“There is no sign of old age about him!”
thought the little book-keeper, and waited to be
addressed.</p>

<p>“Mr. Münster lost three hundred thousand
Rhenish guldens. He could not stand that.”</p>

<p>Christopher Ulwing nodded. Meanwhile he
calculated, cool and unmoved.</p>

<p>“I must see the books and balance sheet of
Münster’s firm.” While he spoke, he reflected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
that he was now rich enough to have a heart. A
heart is a great burden and hampers a man in
his movements. As long as he was rising, he
had had to set it aside. That was over. He had
reached the summit.</p>

<p>“I will help Martin George Münster,” he said
quietly, “I will put him on his legs again, but
so that in future he shall stand by me, not against
me.”</p>

<p>Füger, moved, blinked several times in quick
succession under his spectacles, as if applauding
his master with his eyelids.</p>

<p>This settled business for Christopher Ulwing.
He snuffed the candle. Turning to his son:</p>

<p>“Have you been to the Town Hall?”</p>

<p>John Hubert felt his father’s voice as if it
had gripped him by the shoulder and shaken him.</p>

<p>“Are you not tired, sir?” As a last defence
this question rose to his lips. It might free him
and leave the matter till to-morrow. But his
father did not even deem it deserving of an answer.</p>

<p>“Did you make a speech?”</p>

<p>“Yes....” John Hubert’s voice was soft and
hesitating. He always spoke his words in such
a way as to make it easy to withdraw them. “I
said what you told me to, but I fear it did little
good....”</p>

<p>“You think so?” For a moment a cunning
light flashed up in Christopher Ulwing’s eye,
then he smiled contemptuously. “True. Such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
as we must act. We may think too, but only if
we get a great gentleman to tell our thoughts.
Nevertheless, I want you to speak. I shall make
of you a gentleman great enough to get a hearing.”</p>

<p>Füger bowed. John Hubert began to complain.
“When I proposed to plant trees along
the streets of the town, a citizen asked me if I
had become a gardener. As to the lighting of
the streets they said that drunkards can cling to
the walls of the houses. A lamp-post would
serve no other purpose.”</p>

<p>“That will change!” The builder’s voice
warmed with great strong confidence.</p>

<p>Young Ulwing continued without warmth.</p>

<p>“I told them of our new brickfields and informed
them that henceforth we shall sell bricks
by retail to the suburban people. This did not
please them. The councillors whispered together.”</p>

<p>“What did they say?” asked Christopher Ulwing
coldly.</p>

<p>John Hubert cast his eyes down.</p>

<p>“Well, they said that the great carpenter had
always made gold out of other people’s misery.
The great carpenter! That is what they call you,
sir, among themselves, though they presented
you last year with the freedom of the city....”</p>

<p>Ulwing waved his hand disparagingly.</p>

<p>“Whatever honours I received from the Town
Hall count for little. They have laden me with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
them for their weight to hamper my movements,
so that I may let them sleep in peace.”</p>

<p>“And steal in peace,” said Füger, making an
ironical circular movement with his hand towards
his pocket.</p>

<p>“Let them be,” growled the builder, “there is
many an honest man among them.”</p>

<p>The book-keeper stretched his neck as if he
were listening intently, then bowed solemnly and
left the room.</p>

<p>Christopher Ulwing, left alone with his son,
turned sharply to him.</p>

<p>“What else did you say in the Town Hall?”</p>

<p>“But you gave me no other instructions...?”</p>

<p>“Surely you must have said something more?
Something of your own?”</p>

<p>There was silence.</p>

<p>Young Ulwing had a feeling that he was
treated with great injustice. Was not his father
responsible for everything? He had made him
a man. And now he was discontented with his
achievement. In an instant, like lightning, it all
flashed across his mind. His childhood, his years
in the technical school, much timid fluttering,
nameless bitterness, cowardly compromise. And
those times, when he still had a will to will, when
he wanted to love and choose: it was crushed by
his father. His father chose someone else. A
poor sempstress was not what Ulwing the builder
wanted. He wanted the daughter of Ulrich
Jörg. She was all right. She was rich. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
lasted a short time. Christina Jörg died. But
even then he was not allowed to think of another
woman, a new life. “The children!” his father
said, and he resigned himself because Christopher
Ulwing was the stronger and could hold his own
more vehemently. Unwonted defiance mounted
into his head. For a moment he rose as if to
accuse, his jaw turned slightly sideways.</p>

<p>The old man saw his own image in him. He
looked intently as if he wanted to fix forever
that beam of energy now flashing up in his son’s
eye. He had often longed for it vainly, and now
it had come unexpectedly, produced by causes
he could not understand.</p>

<p>But slowly it all died away in John Hubert’s
eyes. Christopher Ulwing bowed his head.</p>

<p>“Go,” he said harshly, “now I am really tired.”
In that moment he looked like a weary old woodcutter.
His eyelids fell, his big bony hands hung
heavily out of his sleeves.</p>

<p>A door closed quietly in the corridor with a
spasmodic creaking. Ulwing the builder would
have liked it better if it had been slammed. But
his son shut every door so carefully. He could
not say why. “What is going to happen when
I don’t stand by his side?” he shuddered. His
vitality was so inexhaustible that the idea of death
always struck him as something strange, antagonistic.
“What is going to happen?” The question
died away, he gave it no further thought. He
stepped towards the next room ... his grandchildren!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
They would continue what the great
carpenter began. They would be strong. He
opened the door. He crossed the dining room.
He smelt apples and bread in the dark. One
more room, and beyond that the children.</p>

<p>The air was warm. A night-light burned on
the top of a chest of drawers. Miss Tini had
fallen asleep sitting beside it with her shabby
prayer book on her knees. The shadow of her
nightcap rose like a black trowel on the wall.
In the deep recess of the earthen-ware stove
water was warming in a blue jug. From the
little beds the soft breathing of children was
audible.</p>

<p>Ulwing leaned carefully over one of the beds.
The boy slept there. His small body was curled
up under the blankets as if seeking shelter in his
sleep from something that came with night and
prowled around his bed.</p>

<p>The old man bent over him and kissed his
forehead. The boy moaned, stared for a second,
frightened, into the air, then hid trembling in his
pillows.</p>

<p>Mamsell Tini woke, but dared not move. The
master builder stood so humbly before the child,
that it did not become a salaried person to see
such a thing. She turned her head away and
listened thus to her master’s voice.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to. Now, don’t be afraid, little
Christopher. It is I.”</p>

<p>The child was already asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>Ulwing the builder stepped to the other bed.
He kissed Anne too. The little girl was not
startled. Her fair hair, like a silver spray, moved
around her head on the pillow. She thrust her
tiny arms round her grandfather’s neck and returned
his kiss.</p>

<p>When, on the tips of his toes, Christopher Ulwing
left the room, Miss Tini looked after him.
She thought that, after all, the Ulwings were
kindly people.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>A glaring white light streamed through the
windows into the room. Winter had come over
the world during the night and the children put
their heads together to discuss it. They had forgotten
since last year what winter was like.</p>

<p>Below, the great green water crawled cold
between its white banks. The castle hill opposite
was white too. The top of the bastions, the
ridges of the roofs, the spires of the steeples,
everything that was usually sharp and pointed
was now rounded and blunted by the snow.</p>

<p>The church tower of Our Lady belonged to
Anne. The Garrison Church was little Christopher’s.
A long time had passed since the children
had divided these from their windows, and,
because Christopher grew peevish, Anne had also
given him the shingled roof of the Town Hall
of Buda and the observatory on Mount St. Gellert.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
She only kept the Jesuits’ Stairs to herself.</p>

<p>“And I’ll tell on you, how you spat into the
clerk’s tumbler. No, no, I won’t give it!” Anne
shook her head so emphatically that her fair hair
got all tangled in front of her eyes. She would
not have given the Jesuits’ Stairs for anything in
the world. That was the way up to the castle,
to Uncle Sebastian. And she often looked
over to him from the nursery window. In the
morning, when she woke, she waved both hands
towards the other shore. In the evening she put
a tallow candle on the window-sill to let Uncle
Sebastian see that she was thinking of him.</p>

<p>Then Sebastian Ulwing would answer from
the other shore. He lit a small heap of straw
on the castle wall and through the intense darkness
the tiny flames wished each other good night
above the Danube.</p>

<p>“The Jesuits’ Stairs are mine,” said Anne resolutely
and went into the other room.</p>

<p>The little boy sulked for some time and then
followed her on tiptoe. In the doorway he
looked round anxiously. He was afraid of this
room though it was brighter than any other and
Anne called it the sunshine room. The yellow-checked
wall paper looked sparkling and even
on a cloudy day the cherry-wood furniture looked
as if the sun shone on it. The chairs’ legs stood
stiffly on the floor of scrubbed boards and their
backs were like lyres. That room was mother’s.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
She did not live in it because she had gone to
heaven and had not yet returned home, but everything
was left as it had been when she went away.
Her portrait hung above the flowered couch, her
sewing-machine stood in the recess near the window.
The piano had been hers too and the children
were forbidden to touch it. Yet, Christopher
was quite sure that it was full of piano-mice,
who at night, when everybody is asleep,
run about in silver shoes and then the air rings
with their patter.</p>

<p>“Let us go from here,” he said trembling,
“but you go first.”</p>

<p>There was nobody in grandfather’s room.
Only some crackling from the stove. Only the
ticking of the marble clock on the writing table.</p>

<p>Suddenly little Christopher became braver.
He ran to the stove. The stove was a solid silver-grey
earthenware column. On its top there
was an urn emitting white china flames, rigid
white china flames. This was beautiful and incomprehensible
and Christopher liked to look at
them.</p>

<p>He pointed to the brass door. Through the
ventilators one could see what was going on inside
the stove.</p>

<p>“Now the stove fairies are dancing in there!”</p>

<p>In vain Anne looked through the holes; she
could not see any fairies. Ordinary flames were
bobbing up above the cinders. The smoke slowly
twisted itself up into the chimney.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>“Aren’t they lovely? They have red dresses
and sing,” said the boy. The little girl turned
away bored.</p>

<p>“I only hear the ticking of the clock.” Suddenly
she stood on tiptoe. When she did so,
the corners of her eyes and of her mouth rose
slightly. She too wanted to invent something
curious:</p>

<p>“Tick-tack.... A little dwarf hobbles in the
room. Do you hear? Tick-tack....”</p>

<p>Christopher’s eyes shone with delight.</p>

<p>“I do hear.... And the dwarf never stops,
does he?”</p>

<p>“Never,” said Anne convincingly, though she
was not quite sure herself, “he never stops, but
we must not talk about it to the grown-ups.”</p>

<p>Christopher repeated religiously:</p>

<p>“The grown-ups must never know. And this
is truly true, isn’t it? Grandpa has said it too,
hasn’t he?”</p>

<p>Anne remembered that grandpa never told
stories about dwarfs and fairies.</p>

<p>“Yes, Grandpa has said it,” the boy confirmed
himself.</p>

<p>The whole thing got mixed up in Anne’s brain.
And from that moment both believed absolutely
that their grandfather had said it and that it was
really a dwarf who walked in the room, hobbling
with small steps, without ever stopping. Tick-tack....</p>

<p>“Do you hear it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>The peaceful silence of the corridor echoed
the ticking of the clock. It could even be heard
on the staircase which sank like a cave from the
corridor to the hall. And then the dwarf vanished
out of the children’s heads.</p>

<p>The back garden was white and the roof
looked like a hillside covered with snow. Where
the dragon-headed gargoyle protruded, the house
turned sharply and its inner wing extended into
the deep back garden. Mr. Augustus Füger
lived there with his wife and his son Otto.</p>

<p>Mrs. Augustus Füger, Henrietta, was for ever
sitting in the window and sewing. At this very
moment, her big bonnet was visible, looking like
a white cat on the window sill. Fortunately,
she did not look out of the window. The garden
belonged entirely to the children. Theirs was
the winged pump of the well, theirs the circular
seat round the apple tree. Their kingdom....
In winter the garden seemed small, but in
summer when the trees were covered with leaves
and the lilac-bushes hid the secret places, it became
enormous. Through its high wall a gate
led to the world’s end; a grilled gate which grown-ups
alone were privileged to open.</p>

<p>Sometimes Anne and Christopher would peep
longingly for hours through its rails. They
could see the roof of the tool-shed, the tar boiler
and a motley of pieces of timber, beams, floorings,
piles. What lovely slides they would have
made if only one could have got at them! The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
old folks called this glorious, disorderly place,
where rude big men in leather aprons used to
work, the timber yard. The children did not
approve of this name, they preferred “world’s
end.” They liked it on a summer Sunday best
when all was quiet and the smell of the heated
timber penetrated the courtyard and even the
house. Then one could believe in the secret
known to Christopher. It was not a timber yard
at all. The grown-ups had no business with it.
It was beyond all manner of doubt the playground
of giant children who had strewn it with
their building bricks.</p>

<p>“And when I sleep, they play with them,” the
boy whispered.</p>

<p>“One can’t believe that just now,” Anne answered
seriously, “when everything is so clear.”</p>

<p>Crestfallen, Christopher walked behind her in
the snow. They only stopped under the porch
in front of a door bearing a board with the inscription
“Canzelei.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> This word sounded like
a sneeze. It tickled the children’s lips. It made
them laugh.</p>

<p>Anne and Christopher knocked their shoulders
together.</p>

<p>“Canzelei.... Canzelei!”</p>

<p>The door opened. The clerk appeared on the
threshold. He was a thin little man with a
starved expression, wearing a long alpaca frock-coat;
when he walked, his knees knocked together.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
Anne knew something about him. Grandpa had
said it when he was in a temper: Feuerlein was
stupid! The only one among grown-ups of
whom one knew such a thing beyond doubt.</p>

<p>The children looked at each other and their
small cheeks swelled with suppressed laughter;
then, like snakes, they slid through the open door
into the office.</p>

<p>“He is stupid, though he is grown up,” Anne
whispered into the boy’s ear.</p>

<p>“And I will spit into his tumbler!” Now they
laughed freely, triumphantly.</p>

<p>Their laughter suddenly stopped.</p>

<p>Mr. Gemming, the draughtsman, had banged
his triangular ruler down and began to growl.
Augustus Füger tugged the sleeve-protector he
wore on his right arm during business hours.</p>

<p>“Don’t grumble, Gemming. Don’t forget
that one day he will be head of the firm, won’t
you, little Christopher? And you will sit in
there behind the great writing table?”</p>

<p>Christopher looked fearfully towards the door
that led to his grandfather’s office. In there?
Always? Quiet and serious&mdash;even when he
wanted to play with his tin soldiers? With a
shudder, he rushed across the room. No, he
would rather not set his foot here again; nasty
place that smelt of ink.</p>

<p>The door from which he had fled opened. Ulwing
the builder showed a strange gentleman
through the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>The little book-keeper began to write suddenly.
Gemming dipped his pencil into the inkstand.
In the neighbouring room the pens
scratched and the children shrank to the wall.
The strange gentleman stopped. Anne saw his
face clearly; it was fat and pale. Under his
heavy double chin the sail-like collar looked
crushed.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the strange gentleman and
cast his eyes down as if he were ashamed of something.
He held out a flabby white hand to Christopher
Ulwing. The hand trembled. His lips
quivered too.</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it, Mr. Münster. It is just
business....”</p>

<p>This was said by the builder under the porch,
and they heard it in the office.</p>

<p>Gemming began to shake the point of the
pencil he had dipped in the ink. Füger blinked
and blinked. Both felt that Martin George
Münster had fallen from his greatness to their
own level. He too was in Ulwing’s service.</p>

<p>When the builder returned, his crooked chin
settled snugly in his open collar.</p>

<p>Suddenly he perceived the children.</p>

<p>“What are <i>you</i> doing here?” He would have
liked to sit down with them on the heap of office
books. Just for a minute, just long enough to
let their hands stroke his face. He took his repeater
out of his pocket.</p>

<p>“It can’t be done.” He still had to settle with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
many people. Contractors, timber merchants,
masons, carters&mdash;they were all waiting behind
the grating, in the big room opening into the
garden. And John Hubert had already twice
thrust his head through the door as if he wanted
to call him. He went on. But on the threshold
he had to turn back. “This afternoon we will
go to Uncle Sebastian. We will take leave of
him before the floating bridge is removed.”</p>

<p>The children grinned with delight.</p>

<p>“We shall go in a coach, shan’t we?” asked the
boy.</p>

<p>“We shall walk,” answered Ulwing drily;
“the horses are needed to cart wood!” And with
that he slammed the door behind him.</p>

<p>“Walk,” repeated Christopher, disappointed.
“I don’t like it. And I won’t go. And I have
a pain in my foot.”</p>

<p>He walked lamely, rubbing his shoulders
against the wall. He moaned pitiably. But
Anne knew all the while that he was shamming.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The old man and the little girl walked
slowly down to the banks of the river.
The little squares of the windows and the
two figures under the porch gazed for a
long time after them. A cold snowy wind was
blowing from the white hills. Water mills
floated on the Danube. Horses, harnessed one
in front of the other, dragged a barge at the foot
of the castle hill, and small dark skiffs moved to
and fro in the stream, as if Pest and Buda were
taking leave of each other before the advent of
winter.</p>

<p>On the shore shipwrights were at work. When
they perceived Christopher Ulwing, they stopped
and greeted him respectfully. A gentleman
came in the opposite direction; he too doffed his
hat. Near the market place ladies and gentlemen
were walking. Everybody saluted Ulwing
the builder.</p>

<p>Anne was proud. Her face flushed.</p>

<p>“Everybody salutes us, don’t they? Are
there many people living here?”</p>

<p>“Many,” said her grandfather, and thought
of something else.</p>

<p>“How many?”</p>

<p>“We can’t know that; the gentry won’t submit
to a census.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>“And are there many children here?”</p>

<p>The builder did not answer.</p>

<p>“Say, Grandpa, you never were a child, were
you?”</p>

<p>“I was, but not here.”</p>

<p>“Were you not always in our house, Grandpa?”
asked the child, indefatigable.</p>

<p>Ulwing smiled.</p>

<p>“We came from a great distance, far, far away,
Uncle Sebastian and I. By coach, as long as
our money lasted, then on foot. In those days
the summers were warmer than they are now.
At night we wandered by moonlight....”</p>

<p>He relapsed into silence. His mind looked
elsewhere than his eyes. The fortress of Pest!
Then the bastions and walls of Pest were still
standing. And he entered the city through one
of its old gates.</p>

<p>“It was in the morning and the church bells
were ringing,” he said deep in thought.</p>

<p>Suddenly it seemed to him that he saw the
town of times gone by, not as a reality, but as
an old, old fading picture. White bewigged
citizens in three-cornered hats were walking the
streets. Carts suspended on chains. Soldiers
in high shakos. And how young and free the
Danube was! Its waters shone more brightly
and its shore swarmed with ship-folk. Brother
Sebastian went down to the bank. He himself
stopped and looked at a gaudy, pretty barge, into
which men were carrying bags across two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
boards. They went on one, returned by the
other. A clerk was standing on the shore, counting
tallies on a piece of wood for every bag.
The half-naked dockers shone with sweat. They
carried their loads on their shoulders just as
their fore-fathers had carried them here on the
Danube for hundreds of years. The boards bent
and swayed under their weight. The clerk
swore. “There are too few men.” He looked
invitingly at Christopher Ulwing. But Christopher
did not touch the bags. His attention
was attracted by something in the sand which
entered his eyes like a pinprick, the glittering
blade of an axe. He remembered clearly every
word he said. “Knock those two boards together.
In an hour we can slide the whole cargo
into the barge.”</p>

<p>Down at the shore, brother Sebastian jumped
into a boat. He pointed with his staff towards
Buda. He called his brother, waving his hand.</p>

<p>“I remain here,” was the determined answer,
and he picked the axe up from the sand.</p>

<p>The clerk watched him carefully and nodded
approvingly. A few minutes later, the bags slid
speedily down the improvised slide, and the barge,
like a greedy monster, gulped them up into
its maw.</p>

<p>The boat and brother Sebastian left the shore.
They were already in the middle of the Danube.
The stream and the oars, chance and will, carried
his life into the opposite town. Christopher Ulwing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
remained in Pest. Next day, he worked
in the office of the ship-broker. Then he went
into the timber yard. Then further. Advancing.
Rising. And the town grew with him as
if their fate had been one.</p>

<p>Vainly did Anne ask a thousand little questions;
her grandfather did not answer. He
walked far behind his present self.</p>

<p>They reached the boat-bridge. Here too the
men saluted. The collector asked for no toll.
At the bridge-head, the sentry presented arms.</p>

<p>“Why?” Anne had asked this question every
time she had crossed the bridge in her short life.</p>

<p>“They know me,” the builder answered simply.</p>

<p>What need was there for the children to know
that he owned the bridge, had contracted for the
right of way over the river; that the many rafts
floating down the Danube were his as well as
the land above them on the banks.</p>

<p>The bridge trembled rhythmically. The
stream rocked the boats. It foamed, splashed, as
if thirsty giant animals were lapping at the hulls
of the many chained little boats. Lamps stood
near the pillars. In the middle, a coloured spot
above the water: the guardian saint of the river,
the carved image of St. John Nepomuk. Beneath
it, people passed to and fro, raising their
hats.</p>

<p>Anne pointed to the saint: “People salute him
too, even more than Grandpa.” And she was a
little envious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>When they reached the castle on the hill, the
little girl began to complain: “I am hungry.”</p>

<p>The stones of the narrow, snow-covered pavement
clattered quietly under the builder’s long,
firm steps.</p>

<p>Around them decaying houses. Yellow, grey,
green. Gilt “bretzels,” giant keys, boots and
horse-shoes dangled into the street from over the
tiny shops, suspended from brackets which were
ornamented with spirals of forged steel.</p>

<p>Above the shop of Uncle Sebastian, a big
watch was hung. From far away Anne recognised
the immobile golden hands on its face.
The tower of Our Lady’s Church cast its shadow
just up to it. It pointed into the street like a
black signpost. The house itself was probably
older than the others. Its upper storey protruded
above the ground floor and was supported
by several beams above the pavement. On the
bare wall, just behind the clock-sign, an inscription,
with curious flourishes, was visible:</p>

<div class="sign">
<div><span class="large smcap">Sebastian Ulwing</span></div>

<div class="top1">CITY CLOCKMAKER
</div>
</div>

<p>The shop was crowded. Neighbours, burghers
from the castle, came here every afternoon to
warm themselves. Uncle Sebastian sat before
his little clockmaker’s table. He was silent.
His white hair, smoothed back from his forehead,
fell on the collar of his violet tail-coat. His figure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
was tall and bent. According to old fashion
he wore knee-breeches. On his heavy shoes the
buckles were a little rusty; the thick white
stockings formed creases. When he perceived
Anne, he began to laugh. He caught her up in
his arms and raised her high into the air.</p>

<p>“Where is little Christopher?”</p>

<p>“He has a pain in his foot,” said the master
builder, bowing to the company. Anne turned
up her nose significantly. The children did not
think Uncle Sebastian belonged quite among the
grown-ups. He understood many things grandfather
could not grasp. They put their heads
together, secretively, affectionately. Anne began
to dangle her little legs in the air and ask for
gingerbread. Then she proceeded to investigate
the shop.</p>

<p>At the bottom of it a semi-circular window
opened on a courtyard. A deep leather armchair
and a long table with curved legs stood in
front of the window. The table was covered
with a lot of old rubbish. The shelves too were
laden with odds and ends. Watches and clocks
covered the grimy walls.</p>

<p>Near the table, a lady tried to sell a <i>repoussé</i>,
silver, dove-shaped loving-cup. Perceiving
Christopher Ulwing, she curtseyed deeply.</p>

<p>“With your permission, I am Amalia Csik,
from the Fisherman’s bastion.”</p>

<p>She wore a hat like a hamper. Everything
on her was faded and shabby. Anne noticed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
that whenever she moved a musty odour spread
from her clothes. In the shop nobody took any
notice of this. All these people were dressed
differently from her grandfather.</p>

<p>“Even the little children are dressed in a modish
way,” the lady said disparagingly. “Of
course, everything in Pest is different from what
we have in Buda.... We, here in the castle,
are faithful to our own ways, thank God. Are
we not, your reverence?”</p>

<p>The castle chaplain nodded several times his
yellow, bird-like head.</p>

<p>“I hear,” said the lady, “that they have started
a fashion paper in Pest.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and they print it in the same type as
the prayer books,” grumbled the chaplain.</p>

<p>The lady gave a deep sigh.</p>

<p>“Notwithstanding that the devil himself is the
editor of fashion papers.”</p>

<p>“Of all newspapers,” said the official censor
of the Governor’s council from beside the stove.</p>

<p>Christopher Ulwing raised one eyebrow in
sign of derision. “Is it the censor who says
that?”</p>

<p>“It is I,” came the answer, emphatically, as if
an incontrovertible argument had been thrust
into the discussion.</p>

<p>“Literary people in Pest have a different opinion,”
grumbled the builder.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it would be better not to drag them
in. As censor, I am a literary man myself....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>The builder was getting more and more impatient.
The censor turned to the chaplain.</p>

<p>“The written word must not serve the ideals
of the individual but the purposes of the State
and Church.”</p>

<p>Christopher Ulwing went to the door. He
would have liked to let a little fresh air into the
place. Suddenly he turned back angrily: “I
suppose, gentlemen, you only approve of mediocrity?”</p>

<p>“Well said, Mr. Builder. Nothing but the
mediocre is useful to the organization of the
State. That which is above or below only causes
uncomfortable disorder.”</p>

<p>He did not himself know why, but, all of a
sudden, Christopher’s thoughts went to the bookshop
of Ulrich Jörg in Pest. He remembered
the young authors who frequented it; their plans,
their manuscripts, detained in the censor’s sieve.
All those ambitious hopes, new dreams and awakening
thoughts, younger than he, a little beyond
his ken, but which he loved as he loved his grandchildren.</p>

<p>He turned his back furiously on the censor
and went to the bottom of the room feeling that
if he spoke he would say something rude.</p>

<p>The chaplain said with indignation:</p>

<p>“All those people from Pest are such rebels!”</p>

<p>The lady exclaimed suddenly: “There comes
the wife of the Councillor of the Governor’s council!
She is wearing her silver-wedding hat!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>All thronged to the door. The shop became
quite dark as the fat “Mrs. Councillor” passed in
front of it. The chaplain and the others took
their hats and followed her; let the people think
they were in her company. Quite a crowd for
Buda, at least six people went down Tárnok
Street at the same time. Even the good lady
with the big hat remembered some urgent business.
She quickly concluded the sale of the loving-cup,
bowed, and rushed after the others.</p>

<p>Christopher Ulwing came forward.</p>

<p>“What a bureaucratic air there is in Buda.
I prefer your friends who come after closing
hours: the lame wood-carver and the old spectacle-maker.
Even if they do not carry the
world forward, they don’t attempt to push it
back.”</p>

<p>Sebastian laughed good-naturedly:</p>

<p>“These too are good people, only different
from you on the other side of the river. We
have time, you are in a hurry. You are for
ever wanting new-fashioned things. Somebody
who reads newspapers told the chaplain that your
son spoke at the Town Hall. Now you want
avenues, lamps, brick-built houses.... What
are we coming to?”</p>

<p>The builder looked deeply and calmly into his
brother’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Brother Sebastian, we have to change or time
will beat us.”</p>

<p>The clockmaker became embarrassed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, but old things, old ways are so pleasant.”</p>

<p>Christopher Ulwing pointed to the loving-cup.</p>

<p>“This too is old, but this has a right to remain
because it is beautiful. Do you remember, our
father too made some like this. The time may
come when you will get a lot of money for it. I
should like to buy it myself.”</p>

<p>Sebastian looked anxiously at his brother.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you won’t sell this either.” The
builder again became impatient. “You buy to
do business, but when it comes to selling....”</p>

<p>The clockmaker took the dove-shaped cup into
his hand. He held it gently, tenderly, as if it
were a live bird. Then he shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, not yet. I will sell it another day.”</p>

<p>“Why not now?”</p>

<p>“Because I want to look at it for some time,”
said Sebastian gently, as if he were ashamed of
himself.</p>

<p>“That’s the way to remain poor. To keep
everything that is old, avoid everything that is
new. Do you know, Brother Sebastian, you are
just the same as Buda....”</p>

<p>“And you are just like Pest,” retorted Sebastian
modestly.</p>

<p>They smiled at each other quietly.</p>

<p>Anne meanwhile was playing at the tool table
and dropping wheels and watch-springs into the
oil bottle.</p>

<p>Uncle Sebastian did not want to spoil her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
pleasure but watched every movement of hers
anxiously. When the child noticed that she was
observed, she withdrew her hand suddenly. She
stared innocently at the walls.</p>

<p>“I am bored,” she said sadly, “I don’t know
what to do. Do tell me a story.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know any to-day,” said Uncle Sebastian.</p>

<p>“You always know some for you read such
a lot....” While saying this she drew from
the pocket of Uncle Sebastian’s coat a well-worn
little green book.</p>

<p>“Demokritos, or the posthumous writings of
a laughing philosopher.” This was Sebastian
Ulwing’s favorite book.</p>

<p>“Here you are!” cried Anne, waving her prey
triumphantly. “Now come along, tell me a
story.”</p>

<p>The clockmaker shook his head. It still
weighed on his mind that he and the builder could
never understand each other. He was proud of
his brother. He felt his will, his strength, but
that was wellnigh all he knew about him. Had
he rejoiced, had he suffered in life? Had he ever
loved, or did he have no love for anybody?...
He thought of Barbara, his brother’s dead wife,
whom Brother Christopher had snatched from
him and taken to the altar, because he did not
know that he, Sebastian, had loved her silently for
a long time. His forehead went up in many
wrinkles.... We human beings trample our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
fellow creatures under our feet because we don’t
know them.</p>

<p>Anne took his hand and wrung it slowly. “Do
tell me a story, do!”</p>

<p>Inside, in front of the courtyard window, the
builder turned the pages of an old book.</p>

<p>Uncle Sebastian sat down and lifted Anne
into his lap. Casting occasional glances on his
brother’s face, as if he were reading in it, he began
to tell his story.</p>

<p>“It happened a long, long time ago, even before
I was born, in the time of the Turkish
Pasha’s rule. A gay city it was then, was Buda.
In every street shops dealing in masks and fancy
dresses were opened. When Carnival time came,
folk used to walk a-singing in the streets of the
castle; old ones, young ones, in gaudy fancy
dress, with little iron lamps&mdash;such a crazy procession!
The fun only stopped at the dawn of
Ash-Wednesday. All fancy dress shops were
closed and bolted. All were locked, except one
in Fortune’s Street which remained open even
after Ash-Wednesday&mdash;all the year round.</p>

<p>“Singly, secretly, people went to visit it, at
night, when the castle gates had been closed and
the fires at the street corners put out. Among
the buyers were some that had haughty faces.
These bought themselves humble-looking masks.
The cruel men bought kind ones, godless men
pious ones, the stupid clever ones, the clever
simple ones. But the greatest number were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
those who suffered and they bought masks which
showed a laughing face. That is what happened.
It is a true story,” growled Uncle Sebastian, “and
it is just as true that those who once put a mask
on never took it off again. Only on rare occasions
did it fall off their faces, on dark nights
when they were quite alone, or when they loved,
or when they saw money....”</p>

<p>Again he looked at his brother’s face and then
continued in a whisper:</p>

<p>“The business flourished. Kings, princes,
beautiful princesses, priests, soldiers, burghers,
everybody, even the Town Councillors, went to
the shop. Its reputation had even spread down
to the lower town. People from the other side of
the Danube came too. After a time, the whole
world wore masks. Nobody talked about it but
all wore them and the people forgot each other’s
real faces. Nobody knows them any more. Nobody....”</p>

<p>Uncle Sebastian didn’t tell any more and in
the great silence the ticking of the clocks became
loud.</p>

<p>“I didn’t like that story,” said Anne, “tell me
about naughty children and fairies. That’s prettier....”</p>

<p>The clockmaker probably did not hear the
child’s voice. He sat in his low chair as if listening
for someone’s steps, the steps of one who had
passed away. He thought of his tale, of his
brother, of Barbara, of himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>The builder closed the book. He got up.</p>

<p>“Let us go. It is late.”</p>

<p>And the two Ulwings took leave of each other
for the winter.</p>

<p>On the bridge over the Danube the sixteen
lamps were already alight. Their light dropped
at equal distances into the river. The water
played for a time with the beams, then left them
behind. It continued its way in darkness towards
the rock of St. Gellert’s Mount. Only the
chill of its big wet mass was perceptible in the
night.</p>

<p>The snow began to fall anew. A light flared
up here and there in the window of a house near
the shore. The sound of horns was audible on
the Danube.</p>

<p>On the bridge, Anne suddenly perceived her
father. Young Ulwing walked under the lamps
with a girl. They were close together. When
they saw the builder and the child they separated
rapidly and the girl ran in haste to the other side
of the bridge.</p>

<p>Christopher Ulwing called his son.</p>

<p>Leaning against the railing, John Hubert
waited for them; he was for ever leaning on something.
When they reached him, he took hold
of the little girl’s free hand as if he wanted to
put her between himself and his father.</p>

<p>Anne was afraid. She felt that something
was going on in the silence over her head. She
drew her shoulders up. The two men did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
speak for a long time to each other. They
walked with unequal, apparently antagonistic
steps and dragged the trembling child between
them.</p>

<p>It was Christopher Ulwing who broke the silence.
He shouted angrily:</p>

<p>“You promised not to go to her while I was
alive! Can’t I even trust your word?”</p>

<p>“But, sir, don’t forget the child is here!”</p>

<p>“She won’t understand,” retorted the builder
sharply.</p>

<p>Anne understood the words quite clearly, but
what she heard did not interest her. Her
thoughts were otherwise engaged. She felt
keenly that two hands opposed to each other were
pressing her on either side and that some community
of feeling had arisen between her father
and herself. They both feared someone who
was stronger than they.</p>

<p>“I went to meet you, sir,” grumbled John Hubert,
“and met her by chance on the bridge.”</p>

<p>Christopher Ulwing stopped dead.</p>

<p>“Is that the truth?”</p>

<p>“I never told lies.” Young Ulwing’s voice
was honest and sad. It sounded as if he laid
great weight on what he said because it had cost
him so dear.</p>

<p>The builder, still angry, drew out his snuff
box. He tapped it sharply and opened it.</p>

<p>For ever so long there had lived in this box a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
quaint old tune. It woke at the blow and the
snuff box began to play.</p>

<p>“Confound it,” exclaimed Christopher Ulwing,
and tapped it again to silence it, but the box
continued to play.</p>

<p>The two men, as though they had been interrupted
by a comic interlude, stopped talking.
The builder returned the box into his pocket.
Anne bent her head close to her grandfather’s
coat. There was now a sound in it as if a band
of little Christopher’s tin soldiers were playing
prettily, delicately, far, far away.</p>

<p>Florian was waiting with a lantern at the
bridgehead on the Pest side. Many small lamps
moved through the silence. Snow fell in the
dark streets.</p>

<p>But now Anne was leaning her tired head
fully on her grandfather’s pocket. “More!” she
said gently over and over again and inhaled the
music of the snuff box just as Mamsell Tini
breathed in the lavender perfume from her
prayer book.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Winter came many times. Summer
came many times. The children did
not count them. Meanwhile an iron
chain bridge had grown together
from the two banks of the Danube. Even when
the ice was drifting it was not taken to pieces;
it was beautiful and remained there all the year.
The Town Council had planted rows of trees
along the streets. Oil lamps burnt in the streets
at nightfall and the Ulwing house no longer stood
alone on the shore. The value of the ground
owned by the great carpenter had soared. Walls
grew up from the sand. Streets started on the
waste land, stopped, went on again. Work, life,
houses, brick-built houses, everywhere.</p>

<p>Everything changed; only Ulwing the builder
remained the same. His clever eyes remained
sharp and clear. He walked erect on the scaffoldings,
in the office, in the timber yard. He
was a head taller than anybody else. They
feared him at the Town Hall and the contractors
hated him. He quietly went on buying and
building and gradually the belief became a common
superstition that everything the great carpenter
touched turned into gold.</p>

<p>Indoors, in the quiet safe well-being of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
house, the marble clock continued to tick monotonously,
but the children had long ago lost the
belief that it was a lame dwarf who hobbled
through the rooms. For a long time Christopher
had even realized that there were no fairies. His
grandfather had told him so. He shouted at
him and took him by the shoulders:</p>

<p>“Do you hear, little one, there are no fairies
to help us. Only weaklings expect miracles, the
strong perform miracles.”</p>

<p>Little Christopher often remembered his
grandfather killing his fairies. What a terrible,
superior being he seemed to be! He felt like
crying; if there were no fairies, he wondered,
what filled the darkness, the water of the well, the
flames? What lived in them? And while he
searched in bewilderment his eyes seemed to
snatch for support like the hands of a drowning
man.</p>

<p>He grew resigned, however, and called the
“world’s end” the timber yard, just like any
grown-up. Under his rarely moving eyelids his
pale eyes would look indifferently into the air.
Only his voice showed signs of disillusion whenever
he imitated his seniors and spoke in their
language of doings once dear to him.</p>

<p>The years passed by and the magic cave under
the wall of the courtyard became a ditch, the terrifying
iron gate an attic door and the stove
fairies ordinary flames. The piano mice too
came to an end. When a string cracked now and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
then in the house, Christopher opened his eyes
widely and stared into the darkness which had
become void to him.</p>

<p>“Anne, are you asleep?”</p>

<p>“Yes, long ago.”</p>

<p>“I had such a funny dream ... of a girl.
She raised her arms and leaned back.”</p>

<p>“Go to sleep.”</p>

<p>Before Christopher’s eyes the darkness (forsaken
by dwarfs and fairies since he had given
up believing in them) became incomprehensibly
populated. He saw the girl of whom he had
dreamt, her face, her body too. She was tall and
slender, her bosom rigid, she lifted both her arms
and twisted her hair like a black mane round her
head. Just like the sister of Gabriel Hosszu before
the looking-glass when he peeped at her last
Sunday through the keyhole.</p>

<p>“Anne....”</p>

<p>The boy listened with his mouth open. Everything
was silent in the house. Suddenly he
pulled the blanket over his head. He began to
tell stories to himself. He told how the King
wore a golden crown and lived up on the hill in
a white castle. It was never dark in the castle,
tallow candles burnt all the night. His bed
was guarded by slaves, slaves did his lessons for
him, slaves brought a dark-eyed princess to him.
Chains rattled on the princess. “Take them
off!” he commanded. “You are free.” The
princess knelt down at his feet and asked what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
she should give him for his pardon. “Take your
hair down and twist it up again,” he said, said it
quite simply and smiled. And the princess took
her hair down many times and many times twisted
it up again.... He fell asleep and still he
smiled.</p>

<p>He got into the way of dreaming stories. If,
while day-dreaming, somebody addressed him unexpectedly,
it made him jump and blush, as
though caught in the act of doing wrong. Then
he would run to his school books and try hard to
do some work. He learned with ease; once read,
his lesson was learnt, but he could not fix his attention
for any time. Instead of that, he drew
fantastic castles, girls and long-eared cats on the
margins of his copy book. While he was thus
engaged, his conscience was painfully active and
reminded him incessantly that he was expected
to study the reign of King Béla III or the course
of the tributaries of the Danube. Perspiration
appeared upon his brow. In his terror he could
not do his work. Every boy up to the letter U
had already been called up in school and he was
sure that his turn would come next day.</p>

<p>As he had expected, he was questioned and
knew nothing. A fly buzzed in the air. He felt
as though it buzzed within his head. The boys
laughed. Gabriel Hosszu prompted aloud,
Adam Walter held his book in front of him, the
master scolded. But, when the year came to an
end, nobody dared to plough the grandson of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
Ulwing the builder. Christopher began to perceive
that some invisible power protected him
everywhere. The master told him the questions
of the coming examination. For a few coloured
marbles Gabriel Hosszu prompted him in Latin.
For a half penny little Gál, the hunchback, did
his arithmetic homework.</p>

<p>“Things end by coming all right,” thought
Christopher, when the terrifying thought of
school intruded while he drew cats or modelled
clay men in the garden instead of doing his homework.</p>

<p>“That boy can do anything he likes,” said old
Ulwing, delighted with Christopher’s drawings,
and locked them carefully away in one of the
many drawers of his writing-table.</p>

<p>This frightened Christopher. What did the
grown-up people want to do with him? He lost
his pleasure in drawing and gave up modelling
clay men in the courtyard. He became envious
of Anne. She had little to learn and nobody
expected great things from her.</p>

<p>About this time Anne began to feel lonely.
Her bewildered eyes seemed in search of explanations.
She grew fast and her silvery fair hair
became darker as if something had cast a shadow
over it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Füger pushed her spectacles up into the
starched frills of her bonnet and looked at her
attentively.</p>

<p>“Just now you held your head exactly as your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
mother used to. Dear good Mrs. Christina!”</p>

<p>Hearing this, Anne, who stood in the middle
of the back garden, leaned her head still more
sideways. However, it puzzled her that a person
who was still a child could possibly resemble
somebody who was so very old as to have gone
to heaven. Mrs. Füger smiled strangely. In
her old mind, Anne’s mother, who had died
young, could not age and remained for ever so;
while this young girl, who had no memory of her
mother, thought of her as incredibly old.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Christina was sixteen years old when
young Mr. Ulwing asked Ulrich Jörg for her
hand. Sixteen years old. When she came here
she brought dolls with her too. She would have
liked to play battledore and shuttlecock with her
husband in the garden. Every evening she
would slip in here and ask me to tell her stories.”</p>

<p>As if she had been called, Anne ran across
Mrs. Henrietta’s threshold. The house smelt
of freshly scrubbed boards. Many preserve
bottles stood in a row on the top of the wardrobe.
Now and then, the cracking of a dry parchment
cover would interrupt the silence. Anne
crouched down on a footstool and surveyed the
room. It was full of embroidery. “Keys” was
embroidered in German character on the keyboard,
“Sleep well” on a cushion and “Brushes”
on a bag.</p>

<p>“The Fügers must be very absent-minded people,”
mused the little girl; “it is obvious what all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
these things are meant for, and yet they have to
label them.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Henrietta sighed. She could sigh most
depressingly. When she did so, her nostrils
dilated and she shut her eyes.</p>

<p>“Many a time did Mrs. Christina sit here and
make me tell her ghost stories. She loved to
be frightened&mdash;like a child. She was afraid of
everything: of moths, of the cracking of the furniture,
of the master’s voice, of ghosts. At night
she did not dare to cross the garden; Leopoldine
had to take her hand and go with her.”</p>

<p>“Leopoldine? Who was she?”</p>

<p>“My daughter.” Mrs. Füger’s eyes wandered
over a picture hanging on the wall of the bay
window. It represented a grave with weeping
willows, made of hair, surrounded by an inscription
in beads: “Love Eternal.”</p>

<p>“Is she in heaven too?”</p>

<p>“No. Never mention her. Füger has forbidden
it.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Children must not ask questions.”</p>

<p>“Mamsell always gives the same answer and
says God will whisper to me what I ought to
know. But God never whispers to me.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Christina talked just like that. She too
wanted to know everything. When the maids
cast fortunes with candle drippings she was for
ever listening to their talk. Then she blushed,
laughed and sang and played the piano. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
the men in the timber yard stopped work.”</p>

<p>Anne drew her knees up to her chin.</p>

<p>“Could she sing too?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Füger made a sign of rapture. “Sing?
That was her very life. She entered this place
like a song, and left it like one. It rang through
the house and before we could grasp it, it was
gone.”</p>

<p>The little girl did not hear the old lady’s last
words. She was gone and suddenly found herself
in her mother’s room. She knelt down on
the small couch. There hung on the wall the
portrait, which she had always seen, but which
she now examined for the first time.</p>

<p>The delicate water-colour represented a girl
who seemed a mere child. She looked sweet and
timid. Her auburn hair, parted by a shining line
in the middle, was gathered by a large comb on
the top of her head like a bow; ringlets fell on the
side of her face. The childish outline of her
shoulders emerged from a low-cut dress. Her
hand held a rose gracefully in an uncomfortable
position.</p>

<p>Anne felt that if she came back she could talk
to her about many things of which Mamsell and
all the others seemed ignorant. She thought
of the daughters of Müller the apothecary, of
the Jörgs and the Hosszu families, Gál the little
hunchback, of the son of Walter the wholesale
linen-draper, the Münster children. All had
mothers. Everybody&mdash;only she had none.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>And then, like a cry of distress, she spoke a
word, but so gently that she did not hear it, just
felt it shape itself between her lips. Nearer and
nearer she bent to the picture and now she did
hear in the silence her own faint, veiled voice say
the word which one cannot pronounce without
bestowing a repeated kiss on one’s lips in uttering
it: “Mamma!”</p>

<p>She turned suddenly round. Something like
a feeling of shame came over her for talking aloud
when there was nobody in the room, nothing but
a ray of the sun on the piano.</p>

<p>Anne slid down from the couch and opened the
piano. It was dusty. She stroked a key with
her little finger. An unexpected sound rose
from the instrument, a warm clear sound like the
flare of a tinder box. It died down suddenly.
She struck another key; another flare. She drew
her hand over many keys; many flares, quite a
din. She put her head back and stared upwards
as if she saw the flaring little flames of the
notes.</p>

<p>Somebody stroked her face. Her father.</p>

<p>“Would you like to learn to play the piano?”</p>

<p>She did not answer. It was without learning
that she would have liked to play and to sing, so
beautifully that even the men in the timber yard
would lay down their work.</p>

<p>John Hubert became thoughtful.</p>

<p>“All the Jörgs were fond of music. Music
was the very life of your mother.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>Gently Anne opened her blue eyes with a
green glitter in them.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said with determination, “I want
to learn.”</p>

<p>Next day, a gentleman of solemn appearance
came to the house; his name was Casimir Sztaviarsky.
He was at that time the most fashionable
dancing and music master in town. He
wore a coal-black wig, he walked on the tip of
his toes, he balanced his hips and received sixpence
per hour. He mentioned frequently that
he was a descendant of Polish kings. When he
was angry he spoke Polish.</p>

<p>After her lessons, Anne learned many things
from him. Sztaviarsky spoke to her about
Chopin, the citizens’ choir in Pest, Mozart, grandfather
Jörg who played the ’cello well and played
the organ on Sundays in the church of the Franciscan
friars.</p>

<p>The little girl began to be interested in her
grandfather Jörg to whom she had not hitherto
paid much attention. He was different from
the Ulwings. The children thought him funny
and often looked at each other knowingly behind
his back while he was rubbing his hands and bowing
with short brisk nods to the customers of his
bookshop.</p>

<p>Anne blushed for him. She did not like to see
him do this and her glance fell on grandfather
Ulwing. He did not bow to anybody.</p>

<p>Ulrich Jörg’s bookshop was at the corner of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
Snake Street. A seat was fixed in the wall near
the entrance in front of which an apple tree grew
in the middle of the road. The passing carriages
drove round it with much noise.</p>

<p>Anne thrust her head in at the door. Ulwing
the builder removed his wide-brimmed grey
beaver.</p>

<p>The perfume of the apple-blossom filled the
shop. Grandfather Jörg came smiling to meet
them; he emerged with short steps from behind
a bookcase which, reaching up to the ceiling, divided
the shop into two from end to end. The
front part was used by ordinary customers. Behind
the bookcase, shielded from the view of the
street, some gentlemen sat, mostly in Magyar
costumes, on a sofa near a tallow candle and conversed
hurriedly, continuously.</p>

<p>They were more numerous than usual. A
young man, wearing a dolman, sat in the middle
on the edge of the writing table. His neck
stretched bare from his soft open shirt collar.
His hair was uncombed, his eyes were wonderfully
large and aflame.</p>

<p>For the first time in her life Anne realized how
beautiful the human eye could be. Then she
noticed, however, that the young man’s worn-out
boots were battering the brass fittings of Grandfather
Jörg’s writing table while he was speaking
and that his disorderly movements upset everything
within his reach. She thought him wanting
in respect. So she returned to the other side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
of the bookcase and resumed the reading of the
book her grandfather had chosen for her. It was
about a Scotch boy called Robinson Crusoe.</p>

<p>More people came to the shop. Nobody
bought a book. And even the old men looked
as if they were still young.</p>

<p>The feverish, clumsy man behind the bookcase
went on talking and at times one could hear the
heels of his boots knock against the brass fittings.
Anne did not pay any attention to what he said.
The book fascinated her. One word, however,
did reach her ears several times from behind.
But the word did not penetrate her intellect. It
just remained a repeated sound.</p>

<p>In the middle of the shop stood a gentleman.
He had a bony face and he wore a beard only
under his chin. And from the pocket of his tight
breeches a beribboned tobacco pouch dangled.</p>

<p>The man next to him urged him on. “You
can speak out, we are among ourselves.”</p>

<p>The man with a bony face showed a manuscript.
“I have searched in vain since this morning.
People are afraid for their skins. There
is not a printer in Pest who dares set up this
proclamation.”</p>

<p>Ulrich Jörg leaned over the paper. His bald
head reflected the light and the wreath of yellowish
white hair round his ear moved in a funny
way.</p>

<p>“This is not a proclamation,” somebody
whispered. “This means revolution!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>Ulrich Jörg stretched out his hand.</p>

<p>“My printing works will see this through.”
He said this so quietly and simply, that Anne
could not understand why all these gentlemen
should throng suddenly round him. But when
she cast her eyes on him, he no longer looked
funny. His small eyes glittered under the white
eyelashes and his face resembled that of St. Peter
in her little Bible.</p>

<p>Two boys rushed past the door. With shrill
voices they shouted: “Freedom!”</p>

<p>Anne recognised the word she had heard from
behind the bookcase. Mere boys clamoured for
it too. How simple! Everybody wanted the
same thing. Freedom! Somehow it seemed to
her that there was some connection between that
word and another. Youth! And yet another.
Whatever was it? She thought of the awkward
youth’s feverish eye.</p>

<p>From the direction of the Town Hall people
came running down the street; artisans, women,
students, servants. The actors of the German
theatre were among them too. Anne recognised
the robber-knight and the queen. The queen’s
petticoat was torn.</p>

<p>“Hurray for the freedom of the press. Down
with the censor!”</p>

<p>Ulwing the builder, who till then had seemed
indifferent, nodded emphatically. He thought
of the censor at Buda, then he could not help
smiling to himself: from what a small angle does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
man contemplate the world, the world that is so
wide!</p>

<p>The pavement resounded with many hurried
steps. More people came. They too were running,
gesticulating wildly, colliding with each
other. All of a sudden, a voice became audible
outside, a voice like that of spring, penetrating
the air irresistibly.</p>

<p>Somebody spoke.</p>

<p>The bookshop became silent. The men rose.
The voice came to fetch them. The windows
of the houses on the other side of the street were
opened. The voice penetrated the dwellings of
the German burghers. It filled the stuffy rooms,
the mouldy shops, the streets, and whatever it
touched caught fire. This voice was the music
of a conflagration.</p>

<p>Christopher Ulwing went to the door. He
stopped at the threshold. Behind him the whole
shop began to move. Men thronged beside him
into the street. Ulrich Jörg hurried with short,
fast steps side by side with the big-headed shop
assistant. All ran. The builder too, unable to
resist, began to run.</p>

<p>From the street he shouted back to Anne:
“You stay there!”</p>

<p>The bookshop had become empty and the little
girl looked anxiously around; then, as if listening
to music, she leaned her head against the door-post.
She could not see the speaker, he was far
away. Only the sound of his voice reached her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
ear, yet she felt that what now happened was
strangely new to her. A delightful shudder
rippled down her back. The voice made her
feel giddy, it rocked her, called her, carried her
away. She did not resist but abandoned herself
to it and little Anne Ulwing was unconsciously
carried away by the great Hungarian spring
which had now appealed to her for the first time.</p>

<p>When the invisible voice died away, the crowd
raised a shout. A student began to sing at the
top of his voice in front of the shop. All at once,
the song was taken up by the whole street, a song
which Anne was to hear often in days to come.
The student climbed the apple tree nimbly and
waved his hat wildly. His face was aflame;
the branches swayed under his weight and the
white blossoms covered the pavement.</p>

<p>Anne would have liked to wave her handkerchief.
She longed to sing like the student.
General, infinite happiness was floating in the
air. People embraced and ran.</p>

<p>“Freedom!”</p>

<p>A quaint figure approached down the street.
He crawled along the walls with careful, hesitating
steps. He stopped every now and then and
looked anxiously around. His purple tail-coat
fluttered ridiculously, white stockings fell in
thick folds over buckled shoes.</p>

<p>Anne felt embarrassed, afraid. She had never
yet seen Uncle Sebastian like this in the street,
in Pest. Involuntarily, she shrank behind the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
door. “Perhaps he won’t see me. Perhaps he
will walk on....” And the thought of the
feverish eyes, and the word she had connected
with youth.... And the voice.... Uncle
Sebastian was so old and so far away.</p>

<p>Anne cast her eyes down while the rusty buckles
of a pair of clumsy shoes came slowly nearer
and nearer on the pavement.</p>

<p>The student in the tree roared with laughter.</p>

<p>“What sort of scarecrow is this? What olden
times are a-walking?”</p>

<p>Anne became sad and tears rose to her eyes.</p>

<p>“He is mine!” She sobbed in despair and
opened her arms towards the old man.</p>

<p>Uncle Sebastian had noticed nothing of all
this. He sat down on the bench in front of the
bookshop, put his hat on the ground and wiped
his forehead for a long time with his enormous
gaudy handkerchief.</p>

<p>“I just came here in time. What an upheaval!
What are we coming to! What will be the
end of this?”</p>

<p>Again Anne felt a wide gulf between herself
and the old man, and she moved all the closer up
to him so that people who laughed at Uncle Sebastian
might know that they belonged together.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Wind had removed the vernal glory
of the apple tree in front of the
bookshop in Snake Street. Summer
passed away too.</p>

<p>Anne leaned her forehead against the window
pane. A sound came from outside as if a drum
were being beaten underground. The heavy
steps of the new national guard rang rhythmically
along the ground. The house heard it too
and echoed it from its porch.</p>

<p>In those times soldiers were frequently seen
from the window, and when Mamsell Tini took
Anne to the school of the English nuns, the walls
were covered with posters. Crowds gathered before
them. People stretched their necks to get
a glimpse. Anne too would have liked to stop,
but not for anything in the world would Mamsell
Tini let her do so.</p>

<p>“A respectable person must never loiter in the
streets.”</p>

<p>A boy stood on the kerb of the pavement.</p>

<p>“What is there on those posters?” Anne asked
as she passed.</p>

<p>“War news ...” and the boy began to whistle.
An old woman passed on the opposite corner.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
She was wiping her eyes on the corner of
her apron.</p>

<p>“War news....” Anne stared at the old
lady and these words acquired a sad significance
in her mind.</p>

<p>At dinner she watched her grandfather and
father attentively. They talked of business and
in between they were perfectly calm and ate a
hearty meal.</p>

<p>“Everybody is just the same as ever,” she reflected.
“Perhaps the war news is not true after
all.” Suddenly all this was forgotten. Her
father just mentioned that the children would
take dancing lessons every Sunday afternoon
in Geramb’s educational institute.</p>

<p>“It is a smart place,” said John Hubert.
“Baron Szepesy’s young ladies go there and Bajmoczy
the Septemvir’s daughters.” He pronounced
the name “Bajmoczy” slowly, respectfully,
and looked round to see the effect it produced
on his audience.</p>

<p>Next Sunday, Anne thought of nothing but
the dancing school, even when she was at Mass.
She stood up, knelt down, but it meant nothing
to her. She traced with her finger the engraved
inscription on the pew: “Ulwing family.” And
they alone were allowed to sit in this pew though
it was nearest the altar.</p>

<p>Gál, the wine merchant, stood there under the
pulpit, and Mr. Walter the wholesale linen merchant
of Idol Street had no pew. Even the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
Hosszu family sat further back than they, though
they owned water mills and the millers of the
Danube bowed to them.</p>

<p>Anne classified the inhabitants of the parish
according to their pews. During the exhibition
of the Host, while she smote her chest with her
little fist, she decided that her grandfather ranked
before everybody else.</p>

<p>All this time, Christopher Ulwing inclined his
head and prayed devoutedly.</p>

<p>When Anne looked up again, she saw something
queer. Though turning towards the altar,
little Christopher was looking sideways. She
followed his eyes; her glance fell on Sophie
Hosszu. Sophie leaned her forehead on her
clasped hands. Only the lovely outline of her
face was visible. Over her half-closed eyes
her long black eyelashes lay in the shade....
Christopher, however, now sat stiffly, with downcast
eyes, in the pew. Anne could scarcely refrain
from laughing.</p>

<p>Later the hours seemed to get longer and longer
and it appeared as if that afternoon would
never come to an end. The children became
fidgety. The maid brought some leather shoes
from the wardrobe; Anne addressed her reproachfully:</p>

<p>“Oh, Netti, don’t you know? To-day I am
to wear my new prunella boots!”</p>

<p>Her apple-green cashmere frock was hanging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
from the window bolts. The black velvet coat
was spread on the piano. Since last year Anne
had occupied her mother’s former room. The
nursery had become the boy’s sole property.
Christopher too was standing in front of the mirror.
He was parting his fair, white-glimmering
hair on one side; it was so soft it looked as if the
wind had blown it sideways. He was pleased
with himself and while he bent his soft shirt collar
over his shoulders he started whistling. He
never forgot a melody he had once heard. He
whistled as sweetly as a bird.</p>

<p>The rattle of wheels echoed under the porch.
The two “pillar men” glanced into the windows
of the fast receding coach.</p>

<p>In Sebastian Square, in front of Baroness
Geramb’s educational institute, three coaches
were waiting. On one of them a liveried footman
sat beside the coachman. This filled Christopher
with envy. He thought that it would be
a good idea to bring Florian, too, next Sunday.</p>

<p>“Mind you don’t forget to kiss the ladies’
hands!” said John Hubert while they crossed a
murky corridor. Then a tall white-glazed door
led into a sombre dark room. Crooked tallow
candles lit it up from the top of the wardrobes.
Their mild light showed Sztaviarsky, hopping on
tiptoe to and fro, and a row of little girls in
crinolines and boys in white collars. Between
the wings of another door and in the adjoining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
room ladies and gentlemen sat on uncomfortable
chairs. Through lorgnettes on long handles,
they inspected each other’s children.</p>

<p>Christopher at once perceived Sophie Hosszu
among the grown-up people. Though Gabriel
had told him she would be there, it gave him a
shock.</p>

<p>“Go and kiss hands,” whispered John Hubert.
The boy leant forward with such zeal that he
knocked his nose into the ivory hand of the Baroness
Geramb. He also kissed the other ladies’
hands. When he came to Sophie he stared for
a moment helplessly at the young girl. Sophie
snatched her hand away and laughed.</p>

<p>“But, Sophie!” said Baroness Geramb in her
expiring voice and the ringlets dangled on the
side of her face. She was not pleased with her
former pupil. Christopher tripped over a
hooped petticoat, and in his embarrassment felt
as if he wanted to cry.</p>

<p>In the other room, Sztaviarsky held the two
tails of his alpaca evening suit high up in his
hands. He was showing one of the Bajmoczy
girls how to bow.</p>

<p>“Demoiselle Bertha, pray, pray, attention,”
and then he murmured something in Polish.</p>

<p>There was a commotion at the door. “Mrs.
Septemvir” Bajmoczy went to her daughter.
Her silk dress rustled as it slid along the floor.
She was tall and corpulent; her head was bent
backwards and she always looked down on things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>This irritated Sztaviarsky all the more. He
sucked his cheek in and looked round in search
of a victim. “Demoiselle Ulwing, show us how
to make a bow!”</p>

<p>“But I don’t know yet....” Anne said this
very low, and had a feeling as if the floor had
caught hold of her heel. She could only advance
slowly on tiptoe. She bent her head sideways
and her side ringlets touched her shoulders. Her
hand clung to her cashmere petticoat.</p>

<p>The silence was interrupted by Sztaviarsky’s
voice:</p>

<p>“One.... Two ... complimentum.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile John Hubert sat solemnly on a
high, uncomfortable chair and, contrary to his
habit, kept himself erect and never leaned back
once. It seemed to Anne that he nodded contentedly.
Everybody nodded. How good everybody
was to her ... and she started to go
to Bertha Bajmoczy. But the Pole stopped her
with a sign. The lesson continued.</p>

<p>Studies in school suffered seriously that week.
Twice Christopher was given impositions.</p>

<p>The Sundays passed.... In the Geramb educational
institute’s cold, sombre drawing room
the children were already learning the gavotte.</p>

<p>It was towards the end of a lesson. The
crooked tallow candles on the top of the wardrobe
had burnt nearly to the end. Sztaviarsky was
muttering Polish. Bertha Bajmoczy, wherever
she stepped, tripped over her own foot. All of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
a sudden, she began to weep. The young Baroness
Szepesy ran to her; Martha Illey stood in
the middle of the room and laughed wickedly;
Anne had to laugh too. The boys roared.</p>

<p>“Mes enfants.... Silence!” Baroness Geramb’s
voice was more expiring than ever and
her face was stern.</p>

<p>Silence was restored. Bertha wiped her eyes
furiously. She happened to look at Anne.</p>

<p>“Since she came here everything has gone
wrong.”</p>

<p>Clemence Szepesy nodded and pinched her
sharp nose. Anne paid no attention to this.
She looked at her father in surprise. He stood
beside Sophie Hosszu, leaning against the high,
white panel of the door. While he talked, he
kept one of his hands stuck in his waistcoat, which
was adorned with many tiny flowers. With the
other he now and then smoothed his thick fair
hair back from his brow which it bordered in a
graceful curve. He smiled. Until now Anne
had never noticed that her father was still a
young man.</p>

<p>The dancing lesson was over. Walking down
the poorly lit staircase, she heard more talk behind
her. Just where the curving staircase
turned, she was hidden from those coming from
above.</p>

<p>“Her grandfather was an ordinary carpenter,”
said Clemence Szepesy.</p>

<p>“<i>Par exemple</i>, what is that, a carpenter?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>“It’s the sort of fellow,” came the voice from
above, “who worked last spring on the beams of
our attics.”</p>

<p>“Really such people ought not to be admitted
into gentlefolks’ society.” It was Bertha’s
voice.</p>

<p>At first, Anne did not realise whom they were
discussing&mdash;only later. How dared they speak
like that of her grandfather! Of Ulwing, the
master builder! Of him who sat in the first pew
in church and before whom even the aldermen
stood bare-headed!</p>

<p>She turned round sharply. Those behind
found themselves suddenly face to face with her.
They slunk away to the balustrade. Anne gazed
at them bewildered, then her countenance became
sad and scared. She had just discovered something
vile and dangerous that had been hitherto
concealed from her by those she loved. She was
taught for the first time in her short life that people
could be wicked; she had always thought
that everybody was kind. Her soul had till then
gone out with open arms to all human beings
without discrimination; now it felt itself rebuffed.</p>

<p>On the drive home she sat silently in the coach.
Her father spoke of the Septemvir Bajmoczy
and his family. He pronounced the name respectfully,
with unction. This irritated Anne at
first. But her father’s and her brother’s content
pained her only for an instant. She set her teeth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
and decided that she would not tell them what
had happened on the staircase. She felt sorry
for them, more so than for herself, and for the
sake of their happiness and peace of mind she
charitably burdened her maiden soul with the
heavy weight of her first secret.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Sunday had come round again. Christopher
went alone with his father to the
dancing lesson.</p>

<p>“I should like to stay at home,” said
Anne, in her timid, veiled voice. She looked so
imploring that they let her have her way.</p>

<p>At the usual hour in the afternoon the bell
sounded at the gate. Uncle Sebastian stood between
its pillars.</p>

<p>Anne ran to meet him. From his writing
table the builder nodded his head.</p>

<p>“Sit down.” He continued to write close
small numbers into a linen-bound book. He did
not put his pen down till Netti appeared with
coffee on the parrot-painted tray. The steam
of the milkcan passed yellow through the light
of the candle. The smell of coffee penetrated
the room. The two old men now talked of days
gone by.</p>

<p>“Things were better then,” growled Uncle Sebastian
every now and then, without ever attempting
to justify his statement. Meanwhile
he dipped big pieces of white bread into his
coffee. He brushed the crumbs into his hand
and put them into his waistcoat pocket for the
birds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>It struck Anne that her grandfather never
spoke to Uncle Sebastian as he spoke to adults,
but rather in the way he had with her and Christopher.
At first he seemed indulgent, later he
became impatient.</p>

<p>“So it was better then, was it?” And he told
the tale of some noble gentleman who had had
one of his serfs thrashed half-dead because he
dared to pick flowers under the castle window
for his bride. The girl was beautiful. The gentleman
looked at her and sent the serf to the army
against Buonaparte as a grenadier&mdash;for life.</p>

<p>“Nowadays, the noble gentlemen go themselves
to war, and in our parts they even share
their land with their former serfs. Do you understand,
Sebastian? Without compulsion, of
their own free will.”</p>

<p>“Are we noble too?” asked Anne from her corner
of the check-covered couch.</p>

<p>The two old men looked at each other. They
burst into a good-humoured laugh. The builder
rose and took a much-worn booklet out of the
writing desk. On the binding of the book a
double-headed eagle held the arms of Hungary
between its claws.</p>

<p>“This is my patent of nobility. I have sold
neither myself nor anybody else for it.”</p>

<p>Anne opened the book and spelt out slowly
the old-fashioned writing:</p>

<p>“Pozsony. Anno Domini 1797.... Christopher
Ulwing. Sixteen years old. Stature:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
tall. Face: long. Hair: fair. Eyes: blue.
Occupation: civil carpenter.”</p>

<p>Anne blushed.</p>

<p>“That was I,” and the master builder put his
hand on the passport. Then, with quaint satisfaction,
he looked round the room as if exhibiting
with his eyes the comfort he had earned by his
labour. For the first time Anne understood this
look which she had observed on her grandfather’s
face on countless occasions.</p>

<p>“I am a free citizen,” said Christopher Ulwing.
The words embellished, gave power to his sharp,
metallic voice. Unconsciously, Anne imitated
with her small head the old man’s gesture.</p>

<p>The thoughts of Sebastian Ulwing moved less
quickly. They stuck at the passport.</p>

<p>“Do you remember?...” These words carried
the old men beyond the years. They talked
of the mail-coach which had overturned at the
gate of Hatvan. Of the mounted courier from
Vienna, how they made him drunk at the Three
Roses Inn. The gunsmith, the chirurgeon and
other powerful artisans held him down while the
bell-founder cut his pig-tail off though there was
a wire inside to curl it up on his back.</p>

<p>The builder got tired of this subject. He
became serious.</p>

<p>“It was all pig-tails then. People wore them
in their very brains. Withal, times are better
now....”</p>

<p>Sebastian Ulwing shook his head obstinately.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
Suddenly his face lit up, as if he had found the
reason for all his statements.</p>

<p>“We were young then.” He uttered this
modestly and smiled. “My head turns when I
remember your putting shingles on the roof of
the parish church. You sat on the crest-beam
and dangled your feet towards the Danube.
Wouldn’t you get giddy now if you were sent
there!”</p>

<p>Anne, immobile, watched her grandfather’s
hand lying near her on the table. And as if she
wanted to atone for the injury inflicted by the
strange girls, she bent over and kissed it.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” Christopher Ulwing withdrew
his hand absent-mindedly.</p>

<p>Anne cast her eyes down, for she felt as if she
had exhibited a feeling the others could not understand....
Then she slipped unobserved
out of the room.... In the sunshine room a
volume lay on the music chest. On the green
marbled cover were printed the words “Nursery
Songs,” surrounded by a wreath. On the first
page a faded inscription, Christina Jörg, Anno
1822. Anne sat down to the piano. Her small
fingers erred for some time hesitatingly over the
keys. Then she began to sing sweetly one of
the songs:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Two prentice lads once wandered</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To strange lands, far away....</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Shy, untrained, the little song rose. Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
voice, veiled when she talked, rang out clear when
she was singing. She herself was struck by this
difference and it seemed to her that till this
moment she had been mute all her life. She
felt elated by the discovery of the power
to express herself without risking the mocking
derision of the others; now her grandfather
would not draw his hand away from
her.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Two prentice lads once wandered,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To strange lands, far away....</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Uncle Sebastian rose from his armchair and
carefully opened the dining-room door. For a
long time, the two old men listened....</p>

<p>Christopher came home from the dancing
class. He rushed to Anne noisily. His eyes
gleamed with boyish delight. A faded flower
was stuck in his buttonhole. His hand went
for ever up to the flower. He talked and
talked, leaning his elbows on the piano. Anne
looked at him surprised; she found him handsome.
Half his face was hidden by the curls
of his girlish hair. His upper lip was drawn
up slightly by the upward bent of his small nose.
This gave him a charming, startled expression,
not to be found in any other member of the Ulwing
family. Instinctively, Anne looked at her
mother’s portrait....</p>

<p>In the evening when bedtime came, Christopher
searched impatiently for his prayer book.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
He could not find it. He hid the flower under
his pillow.</p>

<p>For a long time, he lay with open eyes in the
dark. Once he whispered to himself: “Little
Chris, I hope to see you again soon,” and in doing
so he tried to imitate Sophie’s intonation.
Then he drew his hand over his head slowly,
gently, just as Sophie had done while speaking
to his father.</p>

<p>He went into a peaceful rapture. He repeated
the stroking, the words “Little Chris....”
He repeated it often, so often that its charm wore
off. It was his own voice he heard now, his
own hand he felt. They ceased to cause a pleasant
tremor; tired out, he went to sleep over
Sophie’s flower.</p>

<p>When Ulwing the builder went next morning
into the dining-room it was still practically dark.
He always got up very early and liked to take
his breakfast alone. A candle burned in the middle
of the table and the flickering of its flame
danced over the china and was reflected in the
mirror of the plate chest. The shadows of the
chair-backs were cast high up on the walls.</p>

<p>Christopher Ulwing read the paper rapidly.</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” he thought. “Send an Imperial
Commissioner with full powers from Vienna?
Why should they?” There was no other news
besides that in the newspaper, crowded though
it was with small print. As if the censor were
at work again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>He carried the candle in his hand into the office.
A big batch of papers lay on the table. John
Hubert’s regular, careful handwriting was visible
on all of them. The builder bent over his work,
his pen scratched spasmodically.</p>

<p>Facing him, the coloured map of Pest-Buda in
its gilt frame became lighter and lighter. The
whitewashed wall of the room was covered with
plans. A couch stood near the stove and this
was all covered with papers.</p>

<p>Steps clattered outside in the silent morning.
Occasionally the shadow of a passing head fell
on the low window and then small round clouds
ran over the paper under Christopher Ulwing’s
pen. Others came and went. Time passed. All
of a sudden many furious steps began running
towards the Danube. The blades of straightened
scythes sparkled in the sun.</p>

<p>The servants ran to the gate.</p>

<p>“What has happened?”</p>

<p>A voice answered back:</p>

<p>“They have hanged the Imperial Commissioner
on a lamp post!”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;they have torn him to pieces....”</p>

<p>“They stabbed him on the boat-bridge.”</p>

<p>“Is he dead?” asked a late-comer.</p>

<p>The builder put his pen down. He stared
at the window as if an awful face were grinning
frightfully at him. “It has been coming for
months. Now it has happened....” Without
any reason he picked up his writings and laid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
them down again. He would have to get accustomed
to this too. His crooked chin disappeared
stiffly in the fold of his open collar and
he resumed the addition of the numbers which
aligned themselves in a long column on the paper.</p>

<p>Outside they sang somewhere the song Anne
had heard for the first time from Grandfather
Jörg’s shop. In the kitchen Netti was beating
cream to its rhythm. And in the evening, just
as on any other day, the lamps on the boat-bridge
were lit, not excepting the one on which a man
had died that day. Its light was just as calm as
the other’s. The streets spoke no more of what
had happened. In the darkness the Danube
washed the city’s bloody hand.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">On Saturday a letter came from Baroness
Geramb. There would be no more
dancing classes.</p>

<p>All the light seemed to go from Christopher’s
eyes.</p>

<p>“But why?” said he, and hung his head sadly.</p>

<p>“Dancing is unbecoming when there is a war
on.”</p>

<p>“So it is true? The war has come,” thought
Anne, but still it seemed to her unreal, distant.
Just as if one had read about it in a book. A
book whose one-page chapters were stuck up
every morning on the walls of the houses.</p>

<p>It was after Christmas. The Danube was
invisible. A dense, sticky fog moved on the
window panes. Christopher ran out shivering
into the dark morning. As usual, he was late;
he had to leave his breakfast and eat his bread
and butter in the street. He had no idea of
his lesson. Behind him Florian carried a lantern.
On winter mornings he always lit the boy’s way
till he reached the paved streets.</p>

<p>On the pavement of the inner town a bandy-legged
old man got in front of Christopher. On
one arm he had a large bundle of grimy papers
while a pot of glue dangled from the other. People<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
in silent crowds waited at the corners of the
streets for him; when they had read the fresh
posters they walked away silent, dejected.</p>

<p>“What is happening? What do they want
with us?” they asked.</p>

<p>People began to understand the grim realities
of war; what was happening now roused their
understanding. They thronged in front of the
money-changers’ shops. Soldiers’ swords rattled
on the pavement. Everybody hurried as if he
had some urgent business to settle before nightfall.</p>

<p>Anne was at her music lesson when a huge
black and yellow flag was hoisted on a flagstaff
on the bastions of Buda. In those times, flags
changed frequently.</p>

<p>“Freedom is dead,” said Sztaviarsky and
cursed in Polish.</p>

<p>“Freedom!” Anne thought of the two feverish
eyes. So it was for freedom’s sake that there
was a war? She now looked angrily on the
Croatian soldiers whom the Imperial officers had
quartered on them. The red-faced sergeant was
eating a raw onion in the middle of the courtyard.
The soldiers, like clumsy big children,
were throwing snowballs. They trod on the
shrubs, made havoc of everything. They made
a snow-man in front of the pump and covered the
head with a red cap like the one worn by Hungarian
soldiers; then they riddled it with bullets....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>The snow-man had melted away. Slowly the
lilac bushes in the garden began to sprout. The
Croatians were washing their dirty linen near the
pump. They stood half-naked near the troughs.
The wind blew soapsuds against their hairy
chests.</p>

<p>All of a sudden an unusual bugle call was
heard; it sounded like a cry of distress. Anne
ran to the window. Soldiers were running in
front of the house. In the courtyard the Croatians
were snatching their shirts from the
trough and putting them on, all soaking. They
rode off after the rest and did not come back
again.</p>

<p>A few days later, Anne dreamed at night that
there was a thunderstorm. Towards morning
there was a sound in the room as if peas by the
handful were being thrown against the window
panes&mdash;many, many peas. Later, as if some invisible
bodies were precipitated through the air,
every window of the house was set a-rattling.</p>

<p>“Put up the wooden shutters!” shouted the
builder from the porch.</p>

<p>Christopher came breathlessly up the stairs.
“School is closed!” His pocket bulged with
barley sugar and he was stuffing it into his mouth,
two pieces at a time.</p>

<p>John Hubert, who had run to school for Christopher,
arrived behind him. His lovely, well-groomed
hair was hanging over his forehead and
the correct necktie had slipped to one side of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
collar. Gasping he called Florian and had the
big gate locked behind him.</p>

<p>A candle was burning in the master builder’s
room, deprived of daylight by the shutters. Contrary
to his habit, John Hubert, without waiting
this time to have a seat offered to him, sank
limply into an armchair.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness you are all here,” he said,
making a caressing movement with his hand in
the air. “I came along the shores of the Danube,”
he continued hoarsely. “There were
crowds of people and they said that the shells
could not reach across the river. People from
the shore sat about on stones. One was eating
bacon. He ate quite calmly and suddenly he
was without a head. For a time the corpse
remained seated, and everything was covered with
blood....” Horrified, he covered his eyes with
his hand.</p>

<p>“So it was a shell that fell into the confectioner’s
shop in Little Bridge Street?” said Christopher,
stuffing barley sugar into his mouth.
“The pavement was all covered with sweets as
if the shop had been turned inside out. The
whole school filled its pockets for nothing.”</p>

<p>The builder smiled. Behind the barred gates
life continued. John Hubert put his necktie
straight and sometimes in the course of the day
forgot completely what he had seen. When he
sat down to meals, however, he became pale.
He pushed his plate aside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>From time to time, the window panes rattled.
Woeful distant shrieks flew over the roofs. They
were followed by the anguish of numb expectancy.
People counted. The silence became
crystalline and quivered in the air.</p>

<p>“The shell has not burst!” They counted
again, in helpless animal fear. Whose turn
would it be next? On the banks of the Danube
a stricken house howled out. Clouds of dust
burst high up into the air. The sky became red,
the colour of bleeding flesh.</p>

<p>The wind blew a wave of hot air, heralding
disaster, into the courtyard of Ulwing the
builder. Behind the locked gate nobody knew
which neighbouring house was expiring in a last
hot breath.</p>

<p>The Fügers hid in the cellar. John Hubert
and the children had moved into the office, situated
in the inner courtyard. The first floor became
empty, except for Christopher Ulwing who
remained in his bedroom, the single window of
which opened into the deserted timber yard.</p>

<p>“The house is strong,” said the builder to Mrs.
Füger through the cellar window. “I built the
walls well.”</p>

<p>A furious crack came from the gate as if it
had been flicked by a wet towel of gigantic dimensions.
The windows broke in a clatter. The
house shook to its foundations.</p>

<p>With frightened lamentations, people rushed
out of the cellar. Little Christopher’s snow-white<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
lips became distorted. The builder
frowned as he used to do when contradicted by
some fool. He went with long steps to the gate.</p>

<p>“No, no,” shrieked Christopher, and began to
sob spasmodically. But old Ulwing listened to
no one. He kicked the side door open. One
of the caryatids was without an arm. Under
him lay a heap of débris of crumbled whitewash
and a huge hole gaped from the wall.
The shell had not exploded; it had stuck in the
brickwork. The builder buttoned his coat up so
as to be less of a target and went to the front
of the house. He cast his eyes upwards. He
contemplated the wrecked windows.</p>

<p>Foreign enemies had hurt his house in the
name of their Emperor. He turned quickly towards
the Danube. The bridge of boats was
aflame. His bridge! He glanced at poor little
Buda, from the heart of which the sister town,
defenceless Pest, was shot to death. The town
and Christopher Ulwing had been small and poor
together; they had risen together, they had become
rich, and now they were wounded together.</p>

<p>He began to curse as he used to do when he
was a journeyman carpenter.</p>

<p>Around him, there was no sign of life. Nothing
moved in the streets. Closed shops. Bolted
doors. The town was a great execution ground.
Like men under sentence of death, the houses
held their breath and were as much abandoned
in their misfortunes as human destinies. Now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
every house lived only for itself, died only for
itself. The glare of the burning roofs was reflected
in different windows. Sticky smoke
crawled along the walls. The bells of a church
near the river tolled.</p>

<p>Rage and pain brought tears to Christopher
Ulwing’s eyes while he glanced over the grimy,
falling houses. How many were his work! He
loved them all. He pitied them, pitied himself....</p>

<p>But this lasted only for a second. He clenched
his fist as if to restrain his over-flowing energy.
He would be in need of it! The muscles of his
arm became convulsed and he felt these convulsions
reflected in his brain. If necessary, he
would start afresh from the very beginning.
There was still time. There was still a long
life before him.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Days passed by. The bombardment
ceased. Frightened shapes emerged
from the cellars. Shrinking against
the walls, they stared at the conflagration
and when they had to cross a street they
rushed to the nearest shelter.</p>

<p>The town waited with bated breath. In Ulwing’s
house, anxiety became oppressive.</p>

<p>Young Christopher did not get out of bed
for a whole week. Sickly fright left its impression
on his face. In daytime he lay speechless
in a corner of the office. Fear prevented him
from sleeping at night; and then he would slink
to the windows.</p>

<p>The black chestnut trees stood gravely in the
back garden. Now and then a distant flaring
light would crown their summits with red. Their
leaves, like flattened bleeding fingers, moved towards
the sky. Between the bushes, something
began to move. The pump handle creaked. A
stable lantern appeared on the ground; in its
light stood men carrying water to the attics.
The builder was there too, working the pump
handle in his shirt sleeves; he was relieved occasionally
by John Hubert, who, however, wore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
a smart coat and white collar which shone in the
dark. Then all went away to rest. The courtyard
became empty.</p>

<p>Christopher was again afraid. He grasped
his neck. He felt as if some fine strings were
quivering in it; this had happened frequently
since the great clap had dealt the house a blow.
In his brain the vision of that incident cropped
up incessantly. He wanted to push it away but
something reached into his brain and pulled it
back.</p>

<p>He would have liked to go to Anne to tell
her all about it. But would she understand? He
could not bear the idea of being laughed at. He
threw himself on his bed and pressed his head
between his two hands. Why could he not be
like the others? Why had he to think forever
of things that the others could not understand?</p>

<p>In the next room, Anne lay sleepless too.
Uncle Sebastian, living up there in the castle,
was never out of her mind since she had had
a glimpse of the spire of Our Lady’s church
through the side door, opened during the bombardment.
The stairs felt cold under her feet
and the door-handles creaked loudly through the
silent house. Crossing the dining-room, she sank
into a chair. She thought with terror of her
grandfather. If he had heard it? He would
never let her do it, yet, however much she was
afraid, however much she trembled, it had to be
done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>She reached the piano. She listened again,
lit the candle, but dared not look round. Her
teeth chattered pitifully while she opened the
shutter. The window was broken. What if the
wind blew the candle out? But the May night
was deep and calm.</p>

<p>Anne felt in her arm a reminiscence of the
old movement with which as a child she used
to wave to Uncle Sebastian across the Danube.
She waved her hand and closed the shutter behind
the illuminated window.</p>

<p>Outside the window the light of the candle
spread yellow into the night as if attempting to
go across the river on the errand on which it had
been sent.</p>

<p>In the mellow, shapeless darkness the castle
formed a rigid compact shadow. No lamps
burned in its steep streets. The houses were
mute and fearful.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For days Sebastian Ulwing had not emerged
from his shop. He spoke to no one, knew of
nothing. He lived on bread and read Demokritos.
Occasionally the gleam of torches came
through the cracks in his door. Their rigid
beam made the round of the shop and then ran
out again. The heavy steps of soldiers resounded
in the street. Sometimes the guns
spoke and the house shook.</p>

<p>On that evening everything was in expectant
silence. It was about ten o’clock. All of a sudden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
it seemed to Sebastian Ulwing that there
had been a knock at his door.</p>

<p>What happened? His heart began to beat
anxiously and he thought of the Ulwing’s house.
He could not endure the doubt, took his hat, but
turned back at the threshold and, as he had done
every evening, he walked again all over the shop.
He wound up all the clocks, looking at them as
if he were giving them food. Then, with his
shaky helpless steps, he crawled out into the
street.</p>

<p>May was all over the deserted castle. The
clockmaker began to hurry. He raised his hat
when he passed the church of Our Lady. He
turned towards the Fisherman’s bastion.</p>

<p>Beyond the wall, down below, the shore of Pest
was black.</p>

<p>Sebastian Ulwing forced his eyes to find the
direction of the Ulwing’s house. He exclaimed
softly. In the long row on the dark shore one
window was lit.... He knew it was for him.
His old heart warmed with gratitude.</p>

<p>Thoughtlessly, he leaned down and swept the
rubbish together that lay about his feet. He
piled it up on the wall of the bastion; then tenderly,
with great care, he tore the title page from
his “Demokritos, or a Laughing Philosopher.”
He took a match. He wanted to thank Anne
for the signal. The paper flared up, the rubbish
caught fire and the flame jumped up with
a shining light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>Just then, the clockmaker felt himself kicked
on the back. He heard a shot and fell on his
knees near the bastion. He grazed his chin
against the wall. Annoyed, he put his hand up
to it. He felt sick. It occurred then to him
to look behind. Nobody was near. The window
of one house rattled. Under the church a
light Austrian uniform disappeared in the dark.</p>

<p>When nothing more was audible, Sebastian
Ulwing held on to the stones and got up. In
front of the church he raised his hat again. Somehow,
he could not put it back on his head: it
dropped out of his hand. He looked sadly after
it but did not bend down for it. For an instant
he leaned against the monument of the Holy
Trinity. As if it were a nail which had pegged
down the square in the middle, only the monument
remained steady; the rest turned round him
slowly, heaving all the time.</p>

<p>“I am giddy,” he thought and spat in disgust.
He wanted to hurry, because he had already
taken many steps and was still in the
square. He felt like a man in a dream who
wants to hurry on and remains painfully on the
same spot.</p>

<p>In the shadow of Tárnok Street he saw light
uniforms. This sight, like a painful recollection,
pushed him forward. His shoulder rubbed
against the houses and suddenly he stumbled
into the shop. The match in his hand evaded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
the wick of the candle with cunning undisciplined
movements.</p>

<p>Sebastian Ulwing fell into the armchair. He
closed his eyes. When he opened them again,
everything seemed to be in a haze. “They make
worse candles now than in olden times,” he reflected,
then he felt suddenly frightened. He
was thirsty. Open the windows. Call somebody.
He could move his body but partially.
He fell back into the armchair. The effort covered
his brow with sweat.</p>

<p>He seemed to hear the guns somewhere. What
did that matter to him. All that concerned
others seemed to him strange and distant now.</p>

<p>To pray.... A child’s prayer came to his
mind. He thought of the past but it tired him
as if it forced him to turn his head. Life was so
good and simple. That Barbara should have
married Christopher was, after all, the right
thing.</p>

<p>A painful confusion went on in his brain.
Without the slightest continuity in his thoughts,
he remembered that he owed the baker a half-penny.
He began to worry; he had just ordered
a pair of shoes at the bootmaker’s. “With bright
buckles.” He had said that. Who was going
to buy these now? Then, for the first time, it
struck him that nobody wore shoes like that nowadays.
Tears came to his eyes. Against his
will, his body fell forward. How rusty those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
buckles on his shoes were ... the one on the
left foot was getting rustier every minute. Rust
seemed to flow on it, red, dense. It was spreading
over the white stocking ... it flowed over
the floor.</p>

<p>The candle burnt to the end. The flame flared
up once more, looked round, went out. The
heavy smell of molten tallow filled the shop and
the head of Uncle Sebastian sank deeper and
deeper between the leather wings of the armchair....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Outside, with the coming day, the firing increased
every moment. But this wild thunder
was not speaking to Pest. From the heights of
the hills of Buda red-capped soldiers bombarded
the castle. The Imperialists retorted hopelessly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The dawn was gray and trembling.</p>

<p>No news penetrated the locked door of Ulwing’s
house.</p>

<p>In the cellar Mrs. Füger was making bandages,
with depressing sighs. The little book-keeper
sat on the top of a barrel and held his
head sideways, as if listening. At every detonation
he banged his heel against the barrel.</p>

<p>His son stared at him so rigidly that his short-sighted
eyes became contracted by the effort.
He yawned with fatigue. Now, old Füger’s feet
struck the side of the barrel at longer and longer
intervals. Only by this did his son notice that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
the firing became less frequent; by and by it
stopped. Then once more the house shook. A
last explosion rent the frightful silence in twain
and broken glass was hurled with loud clatter
from the windows.</p>

<p>“That was somewhere near!”</p>

<p>The builder could stand it no longer. He
wanted to know what was happening. He
rushed up the stairs. In the green room he tore
the shutters deliberately open.</p>

<p>Opposite, the royal castle burned with a smoky
flame and on the bastion, beside the small white
flag of the Imperialists, a tri-colour was unruffled
in the wind.</p>

<p>“Victory!” shouted Christopher Ulwing. His
short ringing voice fell like a blow from a hammer
through the whole house.</p>

<p>Anne began to laugh.</p>

<p>“Do you hear, Christopher, we have won!”</p>

<p>When in the brightness of May the flag was
unfurled on the bastion of the castle and opened
out like a bountiful hand, it scattered joy from
its folds. Its colours were repeated in Pest and
Buda. Tricolours answered from the houses, the
windows, the attics, the roofs. Singing, the people
rushed toward the chain-bridge which resounded
with the irregular trampling of human
feet. The tide swept Ulwing the builder with
it. He went to his brother. So much to tell!
So much to ask!</p>

<p>From the other shore, the people of Buda came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
running. And on the bridge over the Danube
the two towns fell into each other’s arms.</p>

<p>At the foot of the hill there was a crush. A
heavy yellow cart turned into the road. A thin,
yellow-faced man was on the driver’s seat. His
moustaches hung in a black fringe on either side
of his mouth. The cart was covered with canvas.
The canvas was bespattered with dirty red spots.
Human legs and arms protruded from it, swaying
helplessly according to the movements of
the cart.</p>

<p>The crowd had stopped singing. Men took
their hats off. Those in front shouted in horror
at the driver.</p>

<p>The jerks caused a corpse to slip slowly from
under the canvas. Indifferent, the yellow coachman
whipped his horses and the cart went on at
a greater speed. The corpse’s head now reached
the ground. It struck the protruding stones of
the roadway, jumped up with a jerk, and with
glaring open eyes fell back into the street.</p>

<p>The crowd passed by in speechless horror.</p>

<p>Springless carts brought the wounded. The
courtyards of decaying houses were full of red-caps,
bayonets. On the pavement, shiny blue
flies swarmed over a dead horse. From the ditch
of the canal, the soles of two boots protruded.
Carts covered with canvas everywhere. Their
lifeless load swayed slowly in the sun.</p>

<p>Christopher Ulwing turned the corner of Holy
Trinity Square. People stood in front of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
clockmaker’s shop. The first storey jutting over
the street cast a deep shadow in the glaring white
sunshine.</p>

<p>The builder recognised Brother Sebastian’s
friends. The lame wood-carver leaned against
the wall and wiped his eyes. The censor was
there too. He pressed his hand against his face
as if he had a toothache. Those behind him stood
on tiptoe and stretched their necks. When they
perceived him they all took their hats off.</p>

<p>The chaplain’s pointed, bird-like face appeared
in the open door. He walked with important
steps to meet the builder. He spoke at length,
with unction, pointed several times to the sky
and shook his head sideways.</p>

<p>The big bony hands of Christopher Ulwing
clasped each other over his chest, like two twisted
hooks.</p>

<p>“How did it happen?”</p>

<p>Now they all stood round him and all talked
at once. A curious, old-fashioned lady bowed
suddenly in the middle of the road.</p>

<p>“With your kind permission, I am Amalia
Csik. I am entitled to speak. They only heard
it from me. You may remember I live on the
Fisherman’s bastion. Last night my husband
felt unwell, because we hid in the cellar. The
air was bad. So I went up into our rooms for
some medicine.”</p>

<p>The builder turned painfully towards the door
of the shop. The people stood in his way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>“Hurry up,” whispered the chaplain. The
lady went on talking all the faster.</p>

<p>“Pray imagine, I saw the whole thing from my
window. Someone lit a fire on the bastion. I
recognised him at once: the clockmaker. I saw
his face, the flame just lit it up. Then a shot
rang out. And the clockmaker fell to the ground
near the wall.”</p>

<p>Christopher’s heart contracted in anguish. His
eyes reddened as if smoke stung them. “Poor
Brother Sebastian ...” and he could not help
thinking of Anne.</p>

<p>The lady sighed deeply.</p>

<p>“You may imagine I was frightened out of
my wits. I flew back to the cellar. There my
husband explained everything. His reverence
the chaplain knows it too, so do the others; it is
they who broke into the shop after the siege.”</p>

<p>The builder started again towards the shop.</p>

<p>The chaplain made him a sign to stop. He
again lifted his hand to heaven. He spoke of
the country. Of heroes. He turned his pointed
bird-face upward as if inspired.</p>

<p>“And greater love hath no man than this, that
a man lay down his life....”</p>

<p>“Why do you say that?” The builder thought
he could not stand the voice of the priest any
longer.</p>

<p>The chaplain became more and more enthusiastic.</p>

<p>“The name of Sebastian Ulwing will live forever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
in our memory. Buda, the grateful, will
preserve the memory of its heroic martyrs.”</p>

<p>The builder shuddered. He wanted to speak,
but, with an apostolic gesture, the priest opened
his arms to the assembled people.</p>

<p>“And do you who are brought here by your
pious respect for a hero, tell your children and
your children’s children that it was a simple, God-fearing
clockmaker who with signals of fire called
the relieving Hungarian armies into the fortress,
suffering death therefor by a deadly bullet at the
hands of the foe!”</p>

<p>He had grown sentimental over his own eloquence.
The builder, embarrassed, looked
around him. Big coloured handkerchiefs were
drawn. People blew their noses noisily. Mrs.
Amalia Csik stood in the middle of the circle.
She felt very important. She reiterated her
story to every new-comer:</p>

<p>“It happened like this....”</p>

<p>“He is the real hero, the hero of our street,”
affirmed the gingerbread maker from the next
house. The baker too nodded and thought of
the two loaves for which Sebastian Ulwing owed
him.</p>

<p>For a moment the builder stared helplessly
into the priest’s bird-face. He was frightened
by what he had heard. He was agitated, as
if by his silence he had entered a fictitious credit
dishonestly into his ledger. He passed his hand
over his forehead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>“Reverend Mr. Chaplain, allow me.... My
poor brother Sebastian was a peaceful citizen.
He never took any interest in the ideals of the
war of Liberation. He kept carefully out of
revolutionary movements....”</p>

<p>The priest pushed his open palm reprovingly
into the air.</p>

<p>“Master-builder Ulwing, even the <i>humilitas
christiana</i> leaves you free to receive with raised
head the pious praise bestowed on your famous
brother.”</p>

<p>“Listen to me,” shouted Christopher Ulwing
in despair. “It was an accident. Believe me.
You are mistaken....”</p>

<p>The crowd became hostile in its interruptions.
Those behind murmured. Amalia Csik began
to fear for her present importance. She incited
the people furiously, as if this stranger from Pest
had attempted to deprive them of an honour due
to them.</p>

<p>“He is so rich, and yet he left his brother poor.
He never gave him anything. Now he wants
to deprive him of his memory.”</p>

<p>“We won’t let him!” shouted the bootmaker
from Gentleman Street and resolved not to claim
from the builder the price of Sebastian Ulwing’s
buckle shoes.</p>

<p>The chaplain rebuked the builder severely:</p>

<p>“Nobody must grudge us the respect we pay
to our hero!”</p>

<p>Christopher Ulwing’s honest face assumed a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
resigned expression. With a sweeping movement
of his hand he announced his submission.
An entry had been made in the books over which
he had no control. After all, what does it matter
why a man is proclaimed a hero? To signal,
at the risk of one’s life, to a little girl, or to soldiers,
what is the difference?</p>

<p>“I thank you,” he said, scarcely audibly. He
took his hat off and, slightly stooping, entered
the shop. Outside, on the clock-sign, sparrows
were waiting for Brother Sebastian’s crumbs.
Indoors two candles burned. The silence was
broken only by the ticking of the clocks; it
sounded like the beating of many hearts. The
heart of him who wound the clocks beat no more.</p>

<p>Night was falling when the builder descended
from the castle.</p>

<p>“I shall come back for the night,” he said to
the spectacle-maker and the wood-carver, who had
decided to sit up near their old friend. Then he
stepped out smartly, making an effort to keep
his head erect, but his eyes looked dimly upon
the people. He walked as if nobody else existed,
as if he were quite alone. It occurred to him
that throughout all his life he had been alone.
He did not mind; it was the cause of his strength.
To expect nothing from anybody, to lean on no
one. But what he felt now was something quite
different. It was not the solitude of strength,
but that of old age. The house in Pozsony with
its dark corners; his mother’s songs; his father’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
workshop; his youth ... there was nobody left
with him to whom these were realities. When
a man remains alone with the past, it is more
painful than present solitude. It came home
to him what it meant, now that everyone had
gone to whom he could say: “Do you remember?”</p>

<p>Round him soldiers began to flow in. Rows
of men, grimy with sweat and smoke. The
drums beat. The crowd followed on both flanks.
The whole road was singing.</p>

<p>In the windows of the houses handkerchiefs
flickered like white flames.</p>

<p>Anne and Christopher had run to the window.
Opposite, the sun had set already behind the
castle. The outline of Buda, spires, gables,
showed dark on the red sky. A black town on
the top of the hill. On the bridge over the Danube
a dark stream of steel poured over to Pest
... soldiers with fixed bayonets. They too received
the sun on their backs and had their faces
in the shade.</p>

<p>Anne leaned out from the window.</p>

<p>At the head of the troops, the shape of a man
dominated the floating throng. The one in the
red dolman. The leader.... His horse was
invisible. The living stream appeared to carry
him over its head.</p>

<p>From the bridge end on the Pest side he looked
back to the castle. The outline of his features
shone up clear and strong, with Buda as its background.
The sun, reflected violently from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
glasses of his spectacles, sent a vivid flame into
the darkness.</p>

<p>“Do you see them?” shouted Anne and, looking
at the leader she felt as if in his face she saw
all the faces that followed him in the shade&mdash;the
faces of the whole victorious army.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Ulwing the builder gently opened the front
gate.</p>

<p>When Christopher heard that Uncle Sebastian
was dead he began to weep. His sobbing
was audible in the corridor. Anne gazed rigidly,
tearlessly, in front of her.</p>

<p>“Shall I then see him never more?”</p>

<p>“Never.”</p>

<p>Her little face was convulsed. She shut her
eyes for a moment. She would have liked to be
alone.</p>

<p>In the corridor, the Fügers were waiting with
a miserable expression on their faces. The
builder nodded silently to them. He went down
the stairs. He wanted to be alone.</p>

<p>He stopped in the hall. A curious murmur
was audible outside; it spread through the air
with a penetrating force as if it had risen from
the very foundation of things and beings, from
between the roots of the town. He recognised
it. It was the outcry of joy and sorrow; the
breath of the town, and as Christopher Ulwing
listened to it he felt keenly that the breath of the
town and his own were but one. He rejoiced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
with the town. He wept with the town....
The hatred for those who had hurt what was his
own&mdash;his brother, his home, his bridge, so much
of his work&mdash;took definite shape in his heart.</p>

<p>As if facing a foe, he raised his head aggressively.
His eye struck a little tablet hanging
on the opposite door, it bore the German
inscription:</p>

<div class="sign">CANZELEI.
</div>

<p>His jaw turned aside. His steady hand
snatched at the tablet and tore it from its hooks.
He took a mason’s pencil from his waistcoat.
He reflected for a second. Was it spelled in
Hungarian with a T or a D? Then, with vigorous
strokes he wrote on the door<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>:</p>

<div class="sign">IRODA.

<p class="noindent">When on quiet Sunday afternoons
the bell sounded at the door of Ulwing’s
house, a sudden silence fell
over all in the green room. Nobody
mentioned it, yet each of them knew what
came to the others’ minds. This hour was Uncle
Sebastian’s hour.</p>

<p>Summer passed away. One morning, the
bandy-legged little old man emerged again from
the dawn and silently pasted on the walls the
last pages of the great book.</p>

<p>Mamsell Tini protested in vain&mdash;Anne would
stop. She read the poster.</p>

<p>“It is all over.”</p>

<p>She went on, saying never a word, and her
imagination, restricted by the walls of a town,
ignorant of the free, limitless fields, showed her
a quaint picture. She saw in her mind a great
square, something like the Town Hall Market,
but even larger than that. Around it, trees in
a row. Grass everywhere, red-capped soldiers
lying motionless in the grass. Her feverish eyes
closed.</p>

<p>“It is all over....”</p>

<p>One evening, grandfather Jörg was arrested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
in his bookshop. He was led, surrounded by
bayonets, through the town. Many people were
taken like that in those times. Those who remained
free spoke in whispers of these things.
Anne heard something about grandfather Jörg
printing some proclamation; that was why he had
to go to prison. But nobody seemed to know
exactly what happened. The printing press was
closed down by the soldiers; the apple tree at
the corner of Snake Street was cut down and
in the bookshop young Jörg had to place the
bookshelf in such a way that one could see
from the street into the deepest recess of the
shop.</p>

<p>It was many months before Ulrich Jörg was
released. Meanwhile he had turned quite old
and tiny.</p>

<p>The town too looked as if it had aged. People
got accustomed to that. People will get accustomed
to anything. The streets were full of
Imperial officers and quiet women in mourning....
Slowly the traces of the bombardment disappeared.
On Ulwing’s house, however, the
mutilated pillar-man remained untouched.</p>

<p>John Hubert disliked this untidiness.</p>

<p>“It has to stay like that!” growled the builder.
He never told them why.</p>

<p>One day two students passed under the open
window of the office. One of the boys said:
“This old house has got a national guardsman;
look at him, he has been to the war.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>The pen of Christopher Ulwing stopped
abruptly. What? People had already come to
call his house old?</p>

<p>Where were those who shook their heads when
he began to build here on the deserted shore, on
the shifting sands? Since then a town had
sprung up around him. How many years ago
was it? How old was he himself? He did not
reckon it up; the thought of his age was to him
like an object one picks up by chance and throws
away without taking the trouble to examine. Annihilation
disgusted him. He rebelled against
it. He avoided everything that might remind
him of it. To build! To build! One could kill
death with that. To build a house was like building
up life. To draw plans; homes for life. To
work for posterity. That rejuvenates man.</p>

<p>But the town had come to a standstill.</p>

<p>Ulwing the builder called his grandchildren
into his room, and&mdash;a thing he had never done
before&mdash;he listened to their talk attentively. He
was painfully impressed by the discovery that
among themselves they spoke a language differing
from that which they used with him. So the
difference between generations was great enough
to give the very words a different meaning!
Were all efforts to draw them together vain?</p>

<p>He thought of those gone before him. They
too must have known this. They too must have
kept it concealed. How many secrets there must
be between succeeding generations! And each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
generation takes its own secrets with it to the
grave, so that the following may live.</p>

<p>These were Christopher Ulwing’s hardest days.
He built ruined houses up anew. He built himself
up anew too. And while he seemed more
powerful than ever, business men around him
failed and complained.</p>

<p>“Building land will have to be sold; one can’t
stick to things in these times,” said the contractors
and looked enquiringly at Christopher
Ulwing. “What was the great carpenter’s opinion?”
But his expression remained cold and immovable.
Christopher Ulwing never opened the
conversation except when he had to give orders;
otherwise he waited and observed.</p>

<p>In the evening the window of the green room
remained long alight. John Hubert and Augustus
Füger sat there in the cosy armchairs in the
corner and now young Otto Füger was present
too, always respectful, always inquisitive.</p>

<p>“These are bad times,” sighed the little book-keeper,
“one hears of nothing but bankruptcy.”</p>

<p>“One goes down, the other up,” growled the
builder, “never say die.”</p>

<p>“During the revolution it was possible to expect
better times,” said John Hubert, “but at
present....”</p>

<p>His father interrupted him.</p>

<p>“These things too will come to an end.”</p>

<p>“The question is, won’t these things end us
first?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p>“Not me and the town!” said the builder.
“Do you hear Füger? Any building land for
sale by auction has to be bought up. The houses
for sale must be bought too. I have capital. I
have credit. Everything must be bought up.
Within five years I will set the whole thing in
order.”</p>

<p>“Five years....” John Hubert looked at his
father. Time left no mark on him.</p>

<p>Next day, Christopher Ulwing gave his grandson
a book on architecture. Woodcuts of
churches and palaces were in the text.</p>

<p>“We shall build some like that, you and I,
when you are an architect.”</p>

<p>“Write your name in it,” said John Hubert.
“Where is the date? A careful businessman
never writes his name down without a date.”</p>

<p>“Businessman!” This word sounded bleak
in young Christopher’s ears. He looked down
crestfallen and drew his mouth to one side. He
had retained this movement since the shell had
struck the house.</p>

<p>As soon as he felt himself unobserved he put
the book aside. He went to Gál’s. It was still
the little hunchback who did his mathematical
work for him. After that, he bent his steps to
the Hosszu’s; he thought of his Latin preparation.</p>

<p>Christopher had some time since been transferred
to a private school so as to receive his
education in Hungarian. This was his grandfather’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
choice. His father approved of the
school because it admitted only boys of the best
families. Christopher had new schoolmates. All
were children of nobles. They were not the kind
that would have envied young Müller, the apothecary’s
son, the possession of his jars and bottles,
as the boys in Christopher’s old school used to
do. They would not have taken the slightest
interest in gaudy strings and crude-coloured pictures
like those Adam Walter used to produce
from his pockets in playtime. They talked of
horses, saddles, dogs. Practically every one of
them was country-bred and had only come to
town for school.</p>

<p>Christopher continued none the less to go on
Sundays to the Hosszu’s; he saw Sophie rarely;
but when the young lady happened to come accidentally
into Gabriel’s room, the boy would
blush and dared not look at her. But many
were the times when he had gone a long way
round through Grenadier’s Street so that he
might look up stealthily under his hat to the
windows of the Hosszu house.</p>

<p>One afternoon, when he turned into the street
he saw his father going in the same direction.
He wore an embroidered waistcoat and walked
ceremoniously. The boy stopped, stared at him,
then ran away suddenly.</p>

<p>Since the dancing lessons John Hubert had
paid several visits to the Hosszu’s.</p>

<p>An accident revealed to him the cause of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
attraction. One day, on taking his departure,
he left a new yellow glove behind him. He
turned back on the stairs, but Sophie was already
running after him. When she handed him the
glove, her hand felt warm. John Hubert perceived
suddenly that Sophie had lovely eyes and
that her figure was slender.</p>

<p>After this, his visits to the Hosszu’s became
still more frequent. Mrs. Hosszu was knitting
with two yard-long wooden needles near the window
and never looked up, but if Sophie spoke in
whispers to John Hubert she left the room hurriedly.
Occasionally, she stayed out for a very
long time. Then she opened the door unexpectedly,
quietly. And she would look at the
girl with a question in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Why does she look like that?” thought John
Hubert and felt ill at ease.</p>

<p>That day it was Sophie’s father who came in
instead of his wife.</p>

<p>Simon Hosszu was a toothless, red-faced man.
One of his eyes watered constantly for which
reason he wore a gold earring in his left ear. He
spoke of everything quickly, plausibly. He
never gave time for thought.</p>

<p>While John Hubert listened to him he quite
forgot that the name of old Hosszu had lately
been mentioned with suspicion in business circles.</p>

<p>Hosszu owned water mills. The great steam
mill did him considerable damage. None the
less, he spoke as if the water mills had a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
future before them. He got enthusiastic. In
confidence he mentioned brilliant strokes of business
to be done&mdash;timber, plans of lime kilns. A
brewery. A paper mill....</p>

<p>“If I had capital, I should become a rich man.”</p>

<p>John Hubert was bewildered by his audacious
plans. He loved money, and the idea of presenting
plans of his own to his father pleased him.
He raised his brows. He tried to retain it all
in his memory. On leaving he pressed the hand
of Simon Hosszu warmly.</p>

<p>The anteroom was saturated with the smell of
cooking. A dirty towel lay on the table. Sophie
snatched it up and hid it behind her back. John
Hubert took shorter leave of her than usual.</p>

<p>In the street he tried to think of Sophie’s
pretty face, but the odour of the kitchen and the
dirty towel upset him unpleasantly. He began
to think of Simon Hosszu’s various plans. He
could not understand what they amounted to.
Now that he presented Hosszu’s plans in his own
language they seemed less convincing. They became
dim and risky. He had to drop one after
the other. The facts, no longer distorted by eloquence,
glared at him soberly in their real light.</p>

<p>After supper he remained alone with his father
in the green room; they spoke of various firms
and enterprises; he beat round the bush for a
long time.</p>

<p>Christopher Ulwing watched his son attentively,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
with knitted brows. When John Hubert
mentioned the name of Simon Hosszu, the expectant
expression disappeared from the builder’s
face. He leaned back in his chair.</p>

<p>“Simon Hosszu is in a pretty bad way; he
has exhausted his credit everywhere,” and then
he added, indifferently, as if speaking casually:
“It is curious, up to now he has spared us. I
can’t understand what he has in mind.”</p>

<p>John Hubert could not help thinking of Mrs.
Hosszu, who knitted and never looked up, who
left the room and appeared unexpectedly in the
door. His father’s voice rang in his ear: what
had they in mind?... And Sophie? No, she
was not in the conspiracy. He acquitted the
girl in his mind. He felt distinctly that she was
very dear to him.</p>

<p>His bedroom was beyond that of the children.
Everything there was as perfectly in its place
as the necktie on his collar. On the dressing
table, brushes, combs, bottles, jars, all arranged
in order.</p>

<p>John Hubert counted the money in his purse.
He thought how his most cherished wishes had
always been curbed. Now he burnt the natural
desire of a virile man, which in his case was
mingled with the fear of its imminent disappearance;
the knowledge that the hours of his
manhood were already numbered sharpened his
craving. He longed for woman with an intensity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
of which youth is incapable. He wished for
a woman bending to his will, weaker than he, and
the memory of a little sempstress crossed his
mind. How he had loved her, for his dominion
over her and.... Then Sophie’s image abruptly
became confused with the fading picture of the
poor simple girl.</p>

<p>Without any continuity he thought of his children.
“Would Sophie be a good mother to
them?” He asked himself in vain. He could
not answer the question. Mrs. Hosszu, the dirty
towel, Simon Hosszu’s bad reputation, his shady
propositions, his dangerous plausibility....
That influence frightened him and it became clear
to him that henceforth his desire would be
restrained by two hostile forces, the builder’s will
and his own sober brain. In his mind’s eye he
saw Sophie’s lovely shaded eyes looking at him.
They reproached him gently, just as the eyes
of the other girl had done on the day they parted.
John Hubert felt a bitter pain rend him from
head to foot. The old pain, the pain of thwarted
hopes so familiar to him since his youth.</p>

<p>Past and present were all the same to him.
He would not make a clean cut between the two
and he just had to continue to curb the aspirations
of his soul. The ray of light that had shone
on him during the past few months was now extinguished.</p>

<p>He proceeded to turn the key in his watch.
He went on just as before. Gently ticking time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
was again meaningless to him: work and compromise,
that was all. And as he looked up into
the mirror, his face stared at him, tired and
old.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The Inner Town was preparing to celebrate
the centenary of the chemist’s shop
at the sign of the Holy Trinity. The
invitations were extended to distinguished
members of neighbouring parishes.</p>

<p>A crowd gathered in front of the house of
Müller, the chemist in Servites’ Square, to get
a glimpse of the arriving carriages. Through
the house a faint smell of drugs was noticeable.
The stairs were covered with a carpet. This put
the guests into a festive mood. Under the influence
of the carpet Gál the wine merchant and
his wife, who lived on very bad terms with each
other, went arm in arm up the stairs.</p>

<p>Just then Ulwing’s carriage stopped at the
entrance. At the door the chemist received his
guests with many bows.</p>

<p>In the drawing-room new-fashioned paraffin
lamps stood on the mantelpiece in front of the
mirror. The room was packed with many crinolines.
The guests’ faces were flushed. They
spoke to each other in low voices, solemnly.</p>

<p>The wife of the mayor diffused a strong perfume
of lavender round the sofa. Sztaviarsky’s
worn-out wig appeared green in the light of the
lamps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>The Hosszu family arrived. Sophie had become
thin and wore a dress three years old.
Christopher recognised the dress. He did not
know why but he became sad. With an effort
he turned his head away. He did not look at
Sophie, he only felt her presence, and even that
filled him with delight.</p>

<p>The three Miss Münsters walked in through
the door in order of size. They were fat and
pale. Broad blue ribbons floated from the bonnet
of Mrs. George Martin Münster. The last
to come were the family of Walter the wholesale
linen-merchant. Silence fell over the company.
The beautiful Mrs. Walter was usually not invited
to anything but informal parties because
the linen-merchant had raised her from the stage
to his respectable middle-class home. She had
once been a singer in the German theatre and
this was not yet forgotten.</p>

<p>During dinner young Adam Walter was
Anne’s neighbour. The crowded dining-room
was heavy with the smell of food. In the centre
of the table stood the traditional <i>croque-en-bouche</i>
cake.</p>

<p>Anne’s eyes chanced to fall on Christopher.
He seemed strikingly pale among the heavy,
flushed faces. At the end of the table sat Sophie,
mute, broken. Twice she raised her glass to her
lips. She did not notice it was empty. Ignace
Holt, the first assistant of the “Holy Trinity”
Chemist’s shop, leaned towards her obtrusively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>Adam Walter had watched Anne interestedly
for some time without saying a word. He
thought her out of place in these surroundings.
He found in her narrow face a disquieting expression
of youthful calm. It seemed to the
young man as if the warm colour of her hair, a
shaded gold, were spreading under her skin, invading
her innocent neck. Her chin impressed
him as determined, a refined form of the chin of
the Ulwings. Her nose was straight and short.
Her smile raised the corners of her mouth charmingly.</p>

<p>He looked at her forehead. Her fine eyebrows
seemed rather hard.</p>

<p>“What are you thinking of?” he asked involuntarily.</p>

<p>The girl looked at him surprised. The eyes
of Adam Walter were just as brown and restless
as those of his beautiful mother. His brow was
low and broad with bulging temples. Anne had
known him since her childhood, but till now she
had never spoken to him. All she knew about
him was that he had once gone to the same school
as Christopher, that he was a poor scholar and
an excellent fiddler.</p>

<p>“Do you think that people confide their
thoughts to strangers?”</p>

<p>“The brave do,” said young Walter. “I want
to say everything that passes through my mind.
For example, that all these people here are unbearably
tedious. Haven’t you noticed it? Not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
one among them dares say a thing that has not
been said before. Not one does a thing his father
and mother haven’t done before him.”</p>

<p>Adam Walter felt that he had caught the girl’s
attention and became bolder.</p>

<p>“They have no sense whatever. If one of
them is taller than the others he must go about
the world stooping so that no one shall notice
it; otherwise, for the sake of order, they might
cut his head or his legs off. They have to tread
the well-worn path of common-places. Greatness
depends on official recognition. Please,
don’t laugh. It is so. Just now old Münster
told Sztaviarsky that ‘The Vampire’ and ‘Robert
le Diable’ are the finest music in the world.
Marschner and Meyerbeer. Rossini the greatest
of all. Poor Schubert too. That is a comfortable
doctrine. These composers can be admired
without risk. They bear the hallmark on
them. It is a pity it should all be music for the
country fair. Schubert is like a spring shower.
Many small drops, warm soft drops. Is it not
so? Why do you shake your head? You love
Schubert. I am sorry, very sorry. I only said
all this to prove....”</p>

<p>He stopped. He stared into space.</p>

<p>“He exaggerates,” thought Anne, and repressed
what came to her lips. She thought of
her grandfather who had built so much. And
this young man?... His words demolished
whatever they touched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>“You exaggerate,” she said aloud. “I was
taught that old age and those who were before
us ought to be respected.”</p>

<p>“That is not true,” said Adam Walter with
warmth. “I hate every former age because it
stands in the way of my own. The past is a millstone
round our necks. The future is a wing.
I want to fly!”</p>

<p>Anne followed his words bewildered. What
she heard attracted and repelled her. From her
childhood, whenever anything came to her mind
which conflicted with her respect for men and
things, she pushed it aside as if she had seen something
wicked. And this stranger bluntly put
into words what she too had felt, vaguely and
timidly.</p>

<p>Adam Walter spoke of his plans. He would
go abroad, to Weimar. He would write his
sonatas, his grand opera.</p>

<p>“What has been done up to now is nothing.
What has been made is bad, because it was made.
One must create. Like God. Just like Him.
Even the clay has to be created anew.... Is
it not so? The artist must become God, otherwise
let us become linen-merchants.”</p>

<p>His restless eyes shone quaintly. Anne remembered
suddenly two distant feverish eyes
and a word that recalled the word “Youth.” All
at once she felt herself freer. She turned to
Adam Walter. But the young man’s thoughts
must have wandered to another subject, for he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
drew his low forehead furiously into wrinkles.</p>

<p>“Do you know that my father is ashamed of
my mother’s art? And yet how she sings when
we are alone, she and I! When nobody hears
her. My father hides that lovely, imperishable
voice behind his linens. And this is your middle-class
society. It only values what can be measured
by the yard and by the pound. These
things hurt sorely.”</p>

<p>He looked up anxiously. “Did you say anything?
No? I beg of you to imagine she simply
hides her voice. But perhaps you may not know.
My mother was a singer.”</p>

<p>Anne was embarrassed. Hitherto she had
thought that was something to be ashamed of.</p>

<p>Walter asked her rapidly:</p>

<p>“Of course, you sing too. Sztaviarsky told
me. True. I remember. Of all his pupils the
most artistic. Are you going to be a singer?”</p>

<p>In the girl’s heart an instinctive protest rose
against the suggestion.</p>

<p>“But why not?” Adam Walter’s voice became
sad.</p>

<p>Anne did not realise that she answered the
question by looking at Mrs. Walter, living forever
isolated among the others.</p>

<p>“I understand,” said the young man ironically,
“your indulgence extends only to the life of
others, but is limited where your own is concerned.”</p>

<p>Anne knew that he spoke the truth. Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
thoughts alone had been freed to-day. Her
movements were dominated and kept captive by
something. Perhaps the invisible power of ancient
things and ancient men.</p>

<p>The room became suddenly silent. Somebody
rose at the big table. It was Gárdos, the wrinkled
head-physician or “proto-medicus,” as he
was called. He knew of no other remedies for
his patients but arnica, emetics and nux vomica.
Ferdinand Müller half-closed his eyes as if expecting
to be patted on the head.</p>

<p>Anne paid no attention to the proto-medicus’
account of the hundred years’ history of the Müller
family and the “Holy Trinity” shop. She
was toying with her own thoughts like a child
who has obtained possession of the glass case containing
the trinkets.</p>

<p>Others spoke after Mr. Gárdos. The top of
the <i>croque-en-bouche</i> cake inclined to one side.
The dinner was over.</p>

<p>In the next room two Chemist’s assistants had
erected a veiled tablet. Sztaviarsky played some
kind of march on the piano. The guests stood
in a semi-circle. Ferdinand Müller unveiled the
mysterious tablet. A murmur of rapture rose:</p>

<p>“What a charming, kind thought....”</p>

<p>Tears came to the eyes of the chemist. The
admirers of his family and the employees of his
shop had surprised him with a new sign-board.
There shone the two gilt dates. Between them a
century. Underneath, a big white head of Æsculapius,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
bearing the features of Ferdinand
Müller, the chemist. Nothing was wanting;
there were his side whiskers and the wart on his
left cheek. Only his spectacles had been omitted.</p>

<p>Anne and Adam Warner looked at each other.</p>

<p>They felt an irresistible desire to laugh and in
this sympathy they became friends over the heads
of the crowd.</p>

<p>Sztaviarsky played his march at an ever-increasing
speed. The crinolines began to whirl
round. Wheels of airy, frilly tarlatan, pink,
yellow, blue. Dancing had begun round the
piano.</p>

<p>For a brief moment Sophie found herself
pressed against the wall near John Hubert. She
raised her big, soft eyes to his, as if to ask him a
question. But she found something cold, final,
in John Hubert’s looks. The girl turned away.
Her eyes fell on Christopher.</p>

<p>It seemed to the handsome tall boy that Sophie
stroked his face across the room. He looked at
her sharply. The girl seemed again heartlessly
indifferent. Tired, Christopher went into the
next room. There some old gentlemen and bonnetted
ladies were playing <i>l’hombre</i> round a
green table. He went through Mr. Müller’s
study. Then came a quiet little room. Nobody
was in it. The light of a white-shaded paraffin
lamp was reflected in a mirror. He threw himself
into an easy chair and buried his face in his
hands. The sound of the piano knocked sharply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
against his brain. At first this caused him pain.
Then he remembered that the sounds of this
<i>valse</i> reached Sophie too. They touched her
hair, her lips, her bosom. They had invaded her.
It was from her that they came still, a swaying,
treble rhythm which mysteriously embraced the
rhythm of love. They came from her and
brought something of her own self with them.</p>

<p>Christopher leaned his head forward as if attempting
to touch the sound with his lips to kiss
it. Yes, it was swaying music like that he felt
in his endless dreams. Similar rhythmical
pangs wrought in him when he imagined that
Sophie would come to him at night, offering her
love. He hears her steps. Her breath is warm.
Her bosom heaves and whenever it rises, it
touches his face.</p>

<p>“Little Chris....” Just like olden times.
Just the same. “Now I am dreaming. I must
not breathe, or all will be over.” And in his imagination
she caressed him again.</p>

<p>“Little Chris....”</p>

<p>He started. This was reality. Sophie’s
voice. Her breath.... And her bosom
heaved and touched his face.</p>

<p>“Do you still love me?” the girl asked.</p>

<p>In Christopher’s tired eyes despair was reflected.
So she knows? So she has always
known what it has cost him such torture to hide?
Then why has she not been kinder to him? Why
did she leave him to suffer so much?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>“Do you love me?”</p>

<p>“I always loved you,” said the boy and his
voice came dangerously near to a sob.</p>

<p>Sophie stroked him like a child requiring consolation.</p>

<p>“Poor little Chris.... And we are all just
as poor.”</p>

<p>Suddenly her hand stopped on the boy’s brow,
where his hair, like his father’s, curved boldly
over his forehead. He leant his head back and
with a maidenly abandon gave himself up to
Sophie’s will. The girl leaned over him. She
looked at him for a long while, sadly as if to
take leave, then ... kissed his lips.</p>

<p>A kiss, long restrained, meant for another.
And yet, the annihilation of a childhood.</p>

<p>The boy moaned as if he had been wounded
and with the first virile movements of his arms
drew the girl to him. Sophie resisted and pushed
him away, but from the threshold looked back
to him with her big, shaded eyes. Then she was
gone. A feeling rose in Christopher as if she
had carried the world with her.</p>

<p>He went after her. When he passed the card
players, he straightened himself out so as to look
all the taller, all the more manly. He could not
help smiling: they knew nothing. Nobody knew
anything. He and Sophie were alone in the secret
and that felt just like holding her in his arms
among people who could not see.</p>

<p>They were still dancing in the drawing-room.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
Sophie danced with Ignace Hold. Christopher
could not quite understand how she could do such
a thing now. And she looked as if she had forgotten
everything. Nothing showed on her features,
nothing. Women are precious comedians.</p>

<p>He looked at Hold. He turned with the girl
in the usual little circle. His short round nose
shone. He breathed through his mouth. The
points of his boots turned up. On his waistcoat
a big cornelian horse’s head dangled, just on the
spot where one of the buttons strained. “He is
sure to unbutton that one under the table.”
Christopher felt inclined to laugh. Then suddenly
he thought of something else; he heard
someone talk behind his back. He began to listen.</p>

<p>“I should not mind giving him my daughter,”
said Ferdinand Müller; “he is wealthy and a
God-fearing man. Those Hosszu people are
lucky. They are completely ruined. Miss Sophie
isn’t quite young neither.”</p>

<p>Christopher smiled proudly, contemptuously.
They knew nothing. He sought for Sophie’s
glance to find in it a sign of their union, their
mutual possession, from which all others were
excluded.</p>

<p>But the girl was no longer among the dancers.
Her absence made everything meaningless. He
had to think of the quiet little room. “Our
room” ... and he went toward it. He stopped
dead in the door. Sophie was standing there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
now too, just as before, on the same spot. In
front of her Mr. Hold. Christopher saw it
clearly. He saw even the tight button, the
carved horse’s head on his waistcoat. Yet it appeared
to him an awful hallucination. The
horse’s head dangled and touched Sophie. Ignace
Hold raised himself to the tip of his toes.
He kissed the girl’s lips.</p>

<p>Something went amiss in Christopher’s brain.
He wanted to shriek, but his voice remained a
ridiculous groan. The floor sank a little and
then jumped up with a jerk. He felt sick as
if he had been hit in the stomach. With stiff
jerky steps he re-crossed the rooms; he looked
like a drowning man seeking for something to
cling to. In the drawing-room he smiled with
his lips drawn to one side.</p>

<p>“I have a headache,” he said in the ante-room
to Müller the chemist.</p>

<p>When he reached the street, he began to run.
He was in a hurry to get to the Danube. He
rushed unconsciously through a narrow lane.
Under the corner lamp he collided with something;
he ran into a soft warm body. His hat
fell off.</p>

<p>“Is it you?” screeched a female voice and began
to scold.</p>

<p>“For whom do you take me?” Christopher was
painfully aware of the proximity of the soft body.
He stepped back and picked his hat up.</p>

<p>The girl began to laugh shamelessly. For a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
time she scrutinized Christopher curiously. The
boy’s suit was made of costly cloth. His collar
was clean. His necktie white. She tried to
appear genteel.</p>

<p>“I was expecting my brother,” she whimpered.
“I live here near the fishmarket. Perhaps the
young gentleman would see me home?”</p>

<p>“And your brother?”</p>

<p>The girl shrugged her shoulders. They were
already walking side by side through the narrow
lane. They emerged under the rare lamps as
if ascending inclines of light. Then again they
sank into darkness. Above the roofs the narrow
sky appeared like an inverted abyss with
stars at its bottom. Here and there a little light
blinked indifferently, strangely, from a window.
Just like human beings gazing from stout, safe
walls on those excluded.</p>

<p>Christopher felt hopelessly alone. Even the
sound of the girl’s steps seemed foreign. The
darkness was empty. All was falsehood behind
the doors and windows: purity, grace, kisses....
Tears ran down his cheeks.</p>

<p>The girl stopped in front of the door of a low
house. Her expressionless eyes looked into
Christopher’s. She saw that he wept. It was a
familiar sight to her. At first they cry and are
as docile as dogs. All that alters later on.</p>

<p>She began to balance her hips and pressed
against him.</p>

<p>“Come in....” Her voice was heavy and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
like a bird of prey. She unexpectedly pressed
her moist lips on the boy’s mouth.</p>

<p>With disgust Christopher thrust her back.
The girl fell against the door and knocked her
head. But the boy did not care. He gripped
his lips with his hands. There ... just there,
where he had felt Sophie’s kiss before! Now
there remained nothing of it. It had faded from
his lips. Something else had taken its place....
He began to run towards the Danube. In
his flight, he rubbed his hands against the walls
as if to wipe off the moist warmth clinging to his
palms.</p>

<p>He pulled up sharply at the corner lamp.
Again it all rushed to his brain. He gave a cry
and ran back. He wanted to strike the girl
again, strike her hard, to mete out vengeance for
his disgust. Incredible insults came to his mind,
words which till then he did not know he knew,
dirty words like those used by the scum of the
streets. Words! They were blows too, blows
meant for all womankind.</p>

<p>The girl was still standing in the door. Her
body was leaning back. Her arms were raised
and she lazily put up her hair dishevelled by the
blow.</p>

<p>Christopher stared at her with wide-open, maddening
eyes. He looked at her movements; she
seemed to him a corpse which had regained movement
and had come back to life. How her bosom
swelled under her raised arms.... He staggered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
and whined and stretched out a defending
hand.</p>

<p>The girl snatched at the proffered hand. She
dragged Christopher in through the door. The
boy only felt that something had bereft him of
his free will. Something from which it was impossible
to escape.</p>

<p>Two rows of dark doors appeared at the sides
of the filthy courtyard. Fragmentary, hideous
laughter was audible behind one of them. A
reddish gleam filtered through a crack.</p>

<p>Christopher’s steps were insecure on the projecting
cobbles. He stepped into the open reeking
gutter. He shuddered. He was full of
awful expectation, strained fear and tears of inexpressible
pain.</p>

<p>The girl did not release his hand. She
dragged him like her prey. At the bottom of the
courtyard a door creaked. The darkness of a
stuffy room swallowed them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In a city night is never fully asleep. Somehow,
it is forever awake. Here and there
it opens its eye in a window and winks. A
door opens with a gaping mouth. Steps
are about. Their echo strikes the walls of the
houses and resounds to the neighbouring lane
though no one walks there.</p>

<p>The great river breathed heavily, coolly. The
stars spent themselves in the firmament. Christopher
turned from the fishmarket to the embankment
of the Danube. Now and then he
stopped, then he walked on wearily, unsteadily
under the slumbering houses. He went on, full
of contempt. Was that all? So the grown-ups’
great secret was no more than that? He pulled
his hat over his eyes. He was afraid of someone
looking into them.</p>

<p>Florian just opened the gate. His broom
swished with uniform, equal sounds over the
stones of the pavement. When the servant had
finished and had retired to the house, Christopher
slunk in unobserved by the side entrance.</p>

<p>He looked anxiously for a minute towards the
stairs. Candle-light descended from above, step
by step. He did not realize at once what it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
meant. He only felt danger and hid in the
wooden recess of the cellar stairs.</p>

<p>Heavy, firm steps came downward. They
came irresistibly and their sound seemed to tread
on him. He crouched down trembling. He saw
his grandfather. He was going to work. He
carried a candle in his hand. His shadow was
of superhuman height on the white wall. He
himself looked superhuman to the shrinking boy.
Under the porch his shadow extended. It
reached the courtyard. It continued over the
wall. It must have dominated the houses too,
the whole town. Christopher looked after it; he
could not see its end and in his dark recess he felt
himself infinitely small and miserable beside the
great shadow.</p>

<p>Staggering with exhaustion he stole upstairs.
On tiptoe. Along the corridor. One of the big
stone steps was loose. He knew it well. He
avoided it like a traitor.</p>

<p>He stopped for a moment before Anne’s door.
In the clear tranquillity he felt as if some dirt
stuck to his face, his hand, his whole body; degrading,
shameful dirt.</p>

<p>Later on, he lay for a long time with open eyes
in the dark, as he used to in olden times when he
was still a child. The darkness was as empty as
his heart. What he had longed for was gone.
All that remained in his blood was disgust and
fatigue.</p>

<p>He was waked by the noise of the clatter of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
heavy carts under the porch. The steps of workmen
were going towards the timber yard. Ulwing
the builder was not contented to buy
land and houses. Now everything was cheap.
He bought building material from the ruined
contractors. Enormous quantities of timber,
so that his firm might be ready when work
started.</p>

<p>Christopher took no interest in this. At this
time nothing interested him. Even when he
heard that Sophie Hosszu had become the bride
of Ignace Hold he remained indifferent. He
just thought of the cornelian horse-head which
dangled and touched Sophie.</p>

<p>A week passed away. Christopher spoke
practically to nobody in the house, but whenever
he addressed Anne, his expression was sarcastic,
as if he wanted to vent on her his contempt for all
that was woman. He had never felt so strong
and independent as now.</p>

<p>Then ... one night, like a re-opened wound,
a soulless recollection struck him. The recollection
was all body. A female body.</p>

<p>The gloom of the night became populated.
Figures approached, more and more. The darkness
became gradually a huge cauldron, in which
bare arms swarmed, soft outlines, white shoulders,
vulgar female faces.</p>

<p>Next day, Christopher went towards the
fishmarket. He recognised the house. He
knocked. And when he came away again from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
the girl he had learned that for the future he
would need money.</p>

<p>He thought of his grandfather, his father.
He saw them working forever and ever and they
never seemed to spend any money. What were
they doing with it? They must have a lot.
Strangers had told him so. Even the girl with
the bestial eyes knew it, as well as the others,
those with the painted faces who winked in such
a way that only he saw it. How did they know
him? What did they want? Why do they
emerge from their dirty houses when he passes
by? Why do they lie in wait for him at the
street corners? Wait, offer themselves and
follow him obstinately.... And at night when
he wants to sleep their image comes. The room
gets crowded. They sit on his bed. They press
him to give them their pay. But whence is he
to procure the money?</p>

<p>Suddenly he saw his grandfather before him,
as he had seen him from the cellar entrance.
The great shadow at early dawn. He shrank.
He blushed for every one of his miserable
thoughts. It was all dirt. He too was going
to work, hard, honestly, like the old ones. He
would be kind to everybody. Even to Anne he
would be kind. And he would never again set
foot in the house of the girl with the bestial eyes.</p>

<p>But when the hour struck, he again became
restless. To restrain himself, he called to his
mind the image of his grandfather going to work.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
The image faded, became powerless and the
frightful, hideous force attracted him anew. On
the stairs he realised that it was useless to struggle;
the fishmarket called him irresistibly.</p>

<p>Downstairs, in the porch, he found himself unexpectedly
face to face with Anne and his father.
Anne had a bunch of fuchsias in her hand.</p>

<p>“Come with us to the cemetery, to Uncle Sebastian,”
said the girl, getting into the carriage.</p>

<p>Only when he was in the street did Christopher
realise that he had given no answer. He looked
after them.</p>

<p>The carriage was disappearing in the direction
of the Danube.</p>

<p>On the wooden pavement of the chain-bridge
the sound of the wheels became soft. The bridge
swayed gently, in unison with the river as if it
had petrified over the Danube out of the elements
of the water and recalled its origin.
Anne had the feeling that the bridge and the river
were but one and that the carriage was floating.
Before her eyes the sun played on the iron supports
of the bridge as if they were the strings of
a giant harp. The sky looked ever so high and
blue over the castle hill. Beyond, on the old
battlefield, dense grass had grown out of the
many deaths. Behind the acacia trees little double-windowed
middle-class houses were visible:
arched green gates, steep roofs, touching one
another.</p>

<p>“How small everything is here....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>John Hubert looked up.</p>

<p>“One day a city may rise here too. Pest was
not even as big as this when your grandfather
settled in it.”</p>

<p>In front of the carriage the geese fled with
much gabbling in all directions. Dogs barked.
At the Devil’s ditch a shepherd played the flute.</p>

<p>Anne looked about bewildered, thinking of an
old toy of hers. The toy was a farm. The goodwife
was taller than the stable and stood on a
round disc. Trees, geese and the gooseherd all
had round foundations. Instinctively she looked
at the shepherd’s feet and then laughed aloud.
The whole place seemed unreal to her.</p>

<p>Farther on in Christina-town the houses separated.
They stood alone, broad, gaudy, like
peasant women, surrounded by kitchen gardens.</p>

<p>At the communal farm, they left the carriage.
They continued on foot towards the military
cemetery. The citizens of Buda had buried
Uncle Sebastian there.</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Anne. “He was not a soldier.”</p>

<p>“But he was a hero,” answered John Hubert,
though he had never been quite able to understand
Uncle Sebastian’s death. His father kept
silence about the details. On the other hand, the
citizens in the castle told confused stories of great
deeds. He liked to believe what they said because
it flattered him. And whenever the exploits
of the clockmaker were mentioned, he observed
modestly, but with satisfaction, that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
hero was one of his close relations. He grew
used to the honour thrust on him. He bore it
with erected head as he wore his high collars.</p>

<p>Anne remembered something. Three years
ago, her grandfather had said to her, looking
fixedly into her eyes: “The citizens of the castle
consider Uncle Sebastian a hero. They may be
mistaken. You are the only person in the world
who is sure not to be mistaken if you believe
him to be one.” She remembered it well. He
said no more. But from that day he, whom till
then she had merely loved, became also the object
of her admiration and the hero of all around her.</p>

<p>The trees grew between the graves like a wood,
a wood where people were buried. Here it was
not the graves that decided the trees’ position;
they had to take their places as the wood decided.
And life here drew abundant strength from
death’s rich harvest. In many places the stone
crosses had fallen or sunk into the moss. A
weeping willow drooped over a crypt. It bent
over it like a sylvan woman, whose green loose
hair covered a face which was doubtless weeping
in the shade.</p>

<p>Anne prayed for a long time at Uncle Sebastian’s
grave. Then they went on in silence.
Around some graves the gilt spearheads of low
railings sparkled in the grass. Railings, frontiers,
even around the dead, to separate those
who loved each other, to isolate those whom nobody
loved. But Anne felt hopeful that in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
ground, underneath the obstructions erected by
the living, the dead might stretch friendly hands
to each other.</p>

<p>On the hillside the graves ceased. Death vanished
from between the trees, life alone continued.
The wood was their only companion in the summer’s
quietude.</p>

<p>On the edge of a small glen a straw hat lay
on the grass. They looked up surprised. A
bare-headed young man stood in the glen turning
towards the sun. The approaching steps
attracted his attention. His eyes were brown.
His gaze seemed darker than his eyes. He appeared
vexed. Then his eyes fell on Anne. Her
small, girlish face tried hard to remain serious,
but her eyes were already laughing ironically and
her lips were on the verge of doing so. The
stranger felt embarrassed.</p>

<p>John Hubert Ulwing raised his beaver, ruffled
by the boughs. He asked for the footpath leading
to the communal farm.</p>

<p>The young man indicated the direction. His
handsome, manly hand was elegant and narrow.
He wore an old seal ring with a green stone. He
walked a few steps with the Ulwings. When
they reached the footpath, he bowed in silence.</p>

<p>Anne nodded. The waves of her soft shepherdess
hat of Florentine straw threw for an
instant a shadow over her eyes. She was rather
sorry the footpath had been so near. The steps
behind her were already receding. She bent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
down and picked a flower. Only now did
she notice how many flowers there were in the
wood.</p>

<p>She hung her hat over her arm. One more,
one more ... and the bunch grew in her hand.
A Canterbury bell gave itself up, root and all.
The roots, like infinitely small bird-claws, held
on to the moist soil. For the first time Anne
smelt the perfume of the earth. And when the
carriage entered the porch between the two pillar
men, it struck Anne that this was the first occasion
on which wild flowers had come into the
old house.</p>

<p>She met Christopher on the staircase. Her
brother held his head rigid and seemed to be listening.
She too heard her grandfather’s voice.
It came from far away, from the timber yard.</p>

<p>Amidst heaps of dry chips a carpenter had lit
a pipe. The builder was just then inspecting
the yard. He perceived the bluish little cloud of
smoke in the air at once. The blood rushed to
his head. He threatened the man with his fists.
The carpenter, awestruck, knocked his pipe out
and stamped on the burning tobacco. Next to
him, a journeyman began to split a fine big oak
beam; in his fright, he deviated from the right
angle.</p>

<p>Old Ulwing’s face became dark red with anger.
He pushed the man aside and snatched the
axe out of his hand.</p>

<p>“Look here!” he shouted in a voice that made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
all the men surrounding him stop work. Then,
like a captive bird of steel, with a swing the axe
rose in his grip. The chips flew. The oak recognised
its master and split at his powerful will.</p>

<p>Christopher Ulwing forgot everything. His
chest panted and inhaled the savour of the oak.
The inherited ancestral instincts and movements
revived; though displaced for a long time by
strenuous intellectual work and rendered superfluous
by long prosperity, the gigantic strength
of his youth awoke again. There was nothing
in the whole world but the timber of the oak and
himself. For a moment the men got a glimpse of
the great carpenter whose former strength was
the subject of endless and ever increasing tales,
told by the old masters of the craft to the younger
generation.</p>

<p>They saw him for one moment, then something
happened. The raised axe fell out of his powerful
hand and dropped helplessly through the air.
It fell to the ground. The builder grasped his
forehead as if it had been struck by the axe and
he began to sway slowly, terribly, like an old
tower whose foundation gives way. Nobody
dared touch him. Meanwhile the workmen
stared in amazement.</p>

<p>Füger was the first to regain his presence of
mind. He tendered his shoulder to his chief.</p>

<p>John Hubert ran as pale as death across the
yard.</p>

<p>Supported by two powerful journeymen carpenters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
the master builder staggered along. His
bent arms were round the men’s necks. His elbows
were higher than his shoulders. The face
of the old man looked sallow and masklike between
the youthful faces of the men, crimson with
their effort.</p>

<p>“Not there,” he said scarcely audibly when
they tried to drag him to his bed in his room.
He pointed with his chin to the window. They
pushed an armchair in front of it.</p>

<p>Soon the shrivelled face of Gárdos, the proto-medicus,
appeared in the door. When he left
the room, he made the gesture of respectful submission
which is only known to priests and physicians.
Priests make it at the altar, in the presence
of God, physicians when they face death.</p>

<p>“The children....” The builder made an
effort to turn round. His halting look went
slowly round the room.</p>

<p>Christopher clung trembling to the edge of
the table. He had a feeling that if this great
searching glance were to find him, it would strike
upon his pupils and press his eyeballs inwards.
Everything shrank in him. His body wanted
to vanish into space.</p>

<p>So death was like this! He had never seen
it yet, though he had guessed that it hovered
everywhere and whispered fear into men’s ears.
It had whispered to him too when he was a child
and he had to hide under his blankets or run out
of the room when the candle went out. But then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
he did not yet understand the sibilant voice and
his fear went astray among phantoms, deep silence
and darkness. For all that, it had always
been death.</p>

<p>He saw the others near him in a haze. His
father, Füger, Gemming and Feuerlein. The
pointed long face of Tini was there too. It
moved correctly, with an appearance of unreality,
between the washstand and the armchair. It
came and went. A wet towel in her hand. In
the corridor the workmen. Subdued, heavy
steps. Changing, frightened faces in the door.
One pressed against the other, as if looking into
a pit.</p>

<p>Suddenly he perceived Anne. How pale she
was. Yet she moved calmly. Now she knelt
down near the armchair and her face was clasped
by two waxy hands. A grey head bent over her
and gave her a long look, a look insufferably prolonged.
If he were never to release her? If
he were to take her with him?</p>

<p>Christopher sobbed. Someone pushed him
forward. Now he too was kneeling near the
armchair. Now, now.... The fading eyes
had found him. Two hands of wax reached
searchingly into the air, the fingers stretched,
tried to grasp something.</p>

<p>The boy fell to the floor without a sound. He
was not aware that he was carried out of the
room.</p>

<p>Slowly the room became dark. The steps of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
the priest interrupted the solemn silence of the
corridor. Steps came and went. The smell of
incense pervaded the porch. The choir-boy’s
bell rang along the street. He rang as if he
were playing ball with the sounds while one house
was telling another the news:</p>

<p>“Ulwing, the master builder, is dying....”</p>

<p>There was a throng on the staircase. The
heavy, syncopated breathing of the builder was
audible in the corridor. Upstairs in the room,
anxious, tearful faces leant over the armchair.</p>

<p>Since the priest had gone, Christopher Ulwing
had opened his eyes no more. He was speechless
and in the silence his brain fought desperately
against annihilation. It was too early.
He was not yet ready. He rebelled against it.
So many plans.... He wanted to say something.
He sought for words, but could find
none.... The words leading to men were lost....
Colours appeared suddenly between his
eyes and the lids, hard splints of colour, which
seemed to drop into them, pressing on his eyeballs.
Yellow spots. Black rings. Red zigzags.
Then he felt a pleasant, restful weariness,
just like long ago, when he was a child and his
mother carried him in her arms into his bed.
And Brother Sebastian ... they wandered together,
quietly, without fatigue.... A town
becomes visible, church-towers, houses; much
waste land, on which he is going to build. It is
morning and the church bells ring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>John Hubert bent over his father. He was
still breathing. It seemed that his lips moved.</p>

<p>“It is morning!” The builder said that so loud
that they all looked to the window.</p>

<p>Above the further end of the timber yard a
wonderful gleam appeared. Füger looked at
his watch: it was not yet midnight.</p>

<p>The gleam spread every minute. Red dust
and sparks; at first one or two, then more and
more.</p>

<p>The little book-keeper began to perspire. He
recalled all of a sudden to his mind a man with a
leather apron, knocking his pipe out and trampling
on the burning tobacco. Now he remembered
clearly the workman’s heavy boots in the
sawdust. With desperate self-accusation he remembered
that after that he had thought no more
of the matter....</p>

<p>A man ran through the courtyard.</p>

<p>“Fire!”</p>

<p>The cry was repeated, every corner of the
house re-echoed it. Under the steep roof the
walls became orange. An unnatural red glow
spread. Through the window panes light
streamed suddenly into the rooms.</p>

<p>“Fire!”</p>

<p>Now they were shouting it in the street, persistently,
sharply. Carts were thundering towards
the Danube.</p>

<p>John Hubert rushed to the door. At the
threshold it looked as if he were going to fall.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
He staggered and turned back. He began to
calculate, perspiring with fear. His brain added
and multiplied confusedly, intensely. The loss
was gigantic. The quantity of timber and building
material was enormous. The firm might be
shaken by it. Helplessly he stared at his father.
But in the armchair there sat but the ghost of an
old man, smiling like a mask into the light of the
conflagration. Nothing more could be expected
from him. His knees began to shake.</p>

<p>Anne was worn out and looked wearily towards
the window. She did not dare to move her
head. Something was giving way behind her
brow.</p>

<p>Black figures were starting up on the walls
of the yard. They pumped water on the fire.
People were standing on the roofs of the opposite
houses too.</p>

<p>Sooty horrors staggered in the air near the tar
boiler. A suffocating smell of burning poured
through the windows. The conflagration spread
with awful speed. It raced towards the wall of
the back garden.</p>

<p>A burning pile collapsed in the timber yard.</p>

<p>In the ominous light of the rooms Tini and
the maidservants were gesticulating madly before
the open cupboards.</p>

<p>Anne leaned against the wall. “They want
to abandon the house, they want to flee.”</p>

<p>“Save it, save it!” she shrieked with a bloodless
face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>Augustus Füger dropped panting into the
room. He brought news. Now he was gone.
Now he was back again.</p>

<p>The fire had reached the roof of the toolshed.
The air quivered with heat. Hoarse crackling,
spasmodic hissing, mingled with the cries of many
human voices.</p>

<p>The half-closed eyes of the builder rarely
moved. He heard, he saw nothing that happened
around him. He was mysteriously distant
from all that.</p>

<p>Under the window the wasted leaves shrivelled
up with a dry crackling sound. The pump
in the courtyard creaked uniformly. A fire engine
started to spray the hot walls.</p>

<p>In that instant a heavy, clipped voice floated
through the air, like a round disc of metal....</p>

<p>Something passed over the face of Christopher
Ulwing.</p>

<p>“The church bells! It is morning and the
church bells ring.”</p>

<p>All looked at him awestricken. The hands of
the builder gripped the armchair. John Hubert
and Florian supported him on either side.</p>

<p>“Let me go!” That was the shadow of his
old voice. He did not know that nobody obeyed
him any more.</p>

<p>“To build ... to build....” His chin
went all to one side and his body straightened itself
with a frightful effort. The dying Christopher<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
Ulwing towered by a whole head above
the living....</p>

<p>Then, as if something inside him had given him
a twist, he turned half way round. John Hubert
and the servant bent under his weight. In their
arms the builder was dead. He had died standing
and the gleam of the burning oak remained
in his broken eyes.</p>

<p>New water carts arrived below. Bugles
shrieked along the streets. Ladders climbed into
the red air.</p>

<p>Long, panting snakes began to work: the
pumps spat flying water among the flames. But
the fire retreated reluctantly, slowly ... gradually
it collapsed with a hiss.</p>

<p>The alarm bell of Leopold’s Town went on
shouting its clamour, asking for help, calling,
complaining. All parishes responded. The
whole of Pest was alarmed. Sooty débris floated
in the air rent by the tolling of bells. Smoke
covered the yellow walls. The water from the
pumps flew down the window panes.</p>

<p>In that night the old house became really old.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Ulwing the builder was carried out of
the old house and the pillar-men looked
into the hearse. Following behind, the
mitred abbot, lighted wax candles, singing
priests; the Mayor, the Town Councillors,
the flags of the guilds; a big dark mass moving
slowly under the summer sky.</p>

<p>The whole town followed Christopher Ulwing
bare-headed and wherever he passed on his journey,
the bells of many churches tolled. Then the
door of the house was closed. The great master,
the great silence, remained within.</p>

<p>It was on the day after the funeral that the
new head of the Ulwing business took his father’s
seat for the first time at the writing-desk in front
of the barred ground-floor window. The house
was still full of the scent of incense, faded flowers
and the cold smoke of the conflagration.</p>

<p>Nobody moved at that early hour. John Hubert
was quite alone. Several times he put his
hands quite unnecessarily up to his necktie, then,
as if he had been pushed forward, he fell over
the table and wept silently for a long time. He
sat up only when he heard steps in the neighbouring
room. While wiping his eyes, he noticed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
that the china inkstand was not in its usual place.
The sand had been put on the wrong side too.
He made a mental effort and replaced everything
as he used to see it in his father’s time.</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door. He remembered
that this little door, through which people
had come for decades, respectful, bowing, pale
and imploring to the powerful Christopher Ulwing,
now led to him. He raised his head with
confidence, but only for an instant; then, as if
frightened by what life was going to demand
from him, he lowered it again.</p>

<p>Augustus Füger stood in front of him. He
had a parcel of papers under his arm.</p>

<p>John Hubert Ulwing hesitated. He would
now have to make decisions, unaided, all by himself.</p>

<p>“These matters have all been settled according
to the orders of the late master,” said the little
book-keeper, and in his crinkled face the corners
of his mouth went down like those of a child
ready to cry.</p>

<p>Absent-mindedly John Hubert signed his
name. He wiped his pen and stuck it into the
glass full of shot, as his father was wont to do.</p>

<p>And so it was thenceforth. The business went
its old way with the old movements though
around it little by little the world changed. New
men, new businesses rose. The head of the Ulwing
firm did not change anything and externally
his very life became the same as his father’s.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
He seemed to age daily. When he rested, he
closed his eyes.</p>

<p>The damage caused by the fire and the last bad
years of business weighed heavily on his shoulders.
He had to grapple with the liquidation of
grandiose purchases, various charges, old contracts,
and many other problems. These were
all clear and simple to the old builder; they remained
mysterious to him. Their solution was
lost for ever with the cool, mathematical mind of
the builder. With his bony, large, ruthless hands
the power of the house of Ulwing had departed.</p>

<p>John Hubert tried to remedy all troubles by
economy. That was all his individuality contributed
to the business. Cheap tools. Cheap
methods. He even restricted the household expenses
and every Sunday afternoon looked
through Mamsell Tini’s books himself. This
done, he called his son into the green room and
spoke of economy.</p>

<p>Christopher sat with tired eyes, bored, in the
armchair and paid no attention. Absent-mindedly
he extracted the big-headed pin from the
crocheted lace cover, and then, quite forgetting
how it came into his hand, threw it under the
sofa.</p>

<p>Netti brought the coffee on the tray with the
parrot pattern, and lit the paraffin lamp. All of
a sudden Christopher was there no more.</p>

<p>He did not care any more for Gabriel Hosszu,
nor for little Gál. He went to the technical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
high-school. He had an intrigue with an actress,
and the noble youths from the country estates,
whose acquaintance he had made in the private
school, were his friends. He spoke with them
cynically about women. In a back room of the
“Hunter’s Horn” Inn, he watched them for
hours playing cards.</p>

<p>He tried it one day himself. He lost....
He wanted to win his money back. His pocket
was empty, his groping hand only touched his
tobacco-box. He snatched it away. His grandfather
had kept snuff in it. He was ashamed of
the idea that had occurred to him, and he thrust
the box back into his pocket.</p>

<p>A man with thin lips asked him from the other
end of the table:</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>Christopher reached again into his pocket.
“I shall win it all back and never gamble again.”
He drew out the box and banged it on the table.
The knock roused the box. In an old-fashioned,
chirping way, it sang the little song which it had
learned about a hundred years ago from Ulwing
the goldsmith. It sang it just in the same way
but nobody paid any attention to it. When the
music was over, Christopher had lost his game.</p>

<p>In the stifling cigar smoke his breath became
heavy. Voices. Sickly, wine-reeking heat. A
long grey hand removed the snuff-box from the
table.</p>

<p>Christopher rose. He just heard someone say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
behind his back: “He plays like a gentleman.”
He passed wearily beside the tables. He seemed
indifferent. Only in the street did he realise
what had happened and his heart shrank with the
anguish of deep sorrow. Was he sorry for himself
or for the loss of the tobacco-box? He didn’t
know. It had belonged to his grandfather and
now a stranger owned it.... How often had
he seen it in those bony old hands, which had been
raised for a blessing when they were stretched
towards him in the hour of death.</p>

<p>He shuddered with torture and fear. “I am
a scoundrel”; he repeated this several times so as
to shame himself. Then he made a solemn vow
that he would never touch cards any more.
Never, never, again.... This calmed him to
some extent.</p>

<p>When he drew out his new leather case next
day, he noticed that Anne followed him with her
eyes. He observed this several times. Impatient
anger rose in him.</p>

<p>His father left the room. Anne turned to
him.</p>

<p>“Have you lost it?”</p>

<p>“Of course I have!” Christopher was glad to
be able to speak out. He felt relieved, he felt
as though the responsibility for the whole thing
were lifted from his shoulders.</p>

<p>Anne hung her head.</p>

<p>“Do you know where you lost it?... Yes?...”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
Her eyes shone. “What if you promised
a reward to the finder?”</p>

<p>“That requires money,” said Christopher
sadly.</p>

<p>Anne ran to her cupboard. She took a small
box from under her linen.</p>

<p>“It is not much, just my presents. It has
been accumulating slowly for a long time. Little
Chris, go quickly. It will be all right.
Promise the whole lot.”</p>

<p>Christopher was pleased and ashamed at the
same time. He reached out for Anne’s hand.
But the young girl snatched it back. She
stretched herself up to the big boy and tendered
her cheek. Christopher kissed it and ran away.</p>

<p>Anne looked after him. How she loved her
brother! Now, perhaps Christopher understood
all that she could not tell him. He lived for ever
among men and men are ashamed of feeling. To
hide it they whistle and look out of the window.
She too had been brought up with these ideas.
She was taught that feeling is deep and great
only so long as it keeps mute and becomes at once
petty and ridiculous when it raises its voice; so
pitiably petty that it makes one blush and run
out of the room. It must never be shown. Nor
did the others in the house ever display it, nobody
but Uncle Sebastian, long, long ago. And yet
how intensely she longed now and then for somebody
who would show her affection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>Her eyes wandered to her mother’s portrait.
If only she would drop that painted rose from
her hand! If only for once she would caress
her! Only once, one single once, when she was
alone in the room ... so lonely ... always
alone. Since Adam Walter had gone away, nobody
remained with whom she could talk. A
new song, a new book came now and then from
him in distant Weimar. Then silence again for
weeks.</p>

<p>Aimlessly Anne went down the stairs, across
the garden to the great wall. Since the fire the
timber yard had been removed to the end of the
town. Behind the fencing, where in olden times
rude strong men in leather aprons worked the
timber, nothing was left but waste ground.</p>

<p>The memories of her young life came slowly,
dimly at first, then they raced in vivid crowds.</p>

<p>Sunday afternoons. Stories and Uncle Sebastian.
The scent of newly-hewn oak logs and
her grandfather. Music, dreams, her mother’s
portrait. That was all. Years ... years of
childhood.</p>

<p>She sat down on the seat round the apple tree
and leaned her head against the tree’s trunk.</p>

<p>The sky was green between the leaves. The
apple tree was in blossom. Her grandfather
Jörg’s shop came to her mind. And a voice and
a song. How confused all this was. She
thought suddenly of two feverish eyes, but somehow
saw them in Adam Walter’s face. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
Mrs. Walter.... The voice of Bertha Bajmoczy
and railings around men. Small iron
railings even in the cemetery. They ceased on
a hill-side. A glen between the trees. She
might turn her face towards it. And from the
foot-path why should she not turn back, just
simply look behind her without any cause, when
there was nobody left in the glen....</p>

<p>She looked up. She felt eyes resting on her:
Otto Füger was standing in the bushes. From
her childhood she had known this shifty, obstinate
look. It was everywhere, over her father’s
writing-table, in the porch, sometimes even at
night, outside, under the window.</p>

<p>The expression of the short-sighted eyes became
at once persistent and obsequious. Anne
would have liked to cast it from her. She
nodded and went into the house.</p>

<p>In the evening, she sat up late for Christopher.
He did not come. This night seemed longer to
her than any others, it whispered to her anxious,
fearful premonitions.</p>

<p>Next day, Christopher confessed to his sister
that he had gambled and lost. And Anne also
learned that she would never see her grandfather’s
snuff-box again.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It was still spring, but summer had already
touched the Danube and in the middle of
the river the Palatine Island sprang into
bloom like a floating forest.</p>

<p>Anne had no presentiment that she went to
meet her own summer when one day she walked
on the bank of the Danube towards the island.
Christopher, who accompanied her, had, as usual,
been late. The party they had arranged to join
was nowhere to be found. They remained alone
on the shore, deliberating for a short time, and
then made signs to the ferryman. On the other
shore a boat moved under the boughs which
spread over the water and was rowed slowly
across the river.</p>

<p>People from town came to the pier. Anne
heard approaching voices. One person pronounced
her name; another repeated it in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Anne Ulwing....”</p>

<p>She turned round reluctantly. Christopher
raised his hat.</p>

<p>A boyish-looking slender girl came towards
them along the grey pier.</p>

<p>“Don’t you recognise me?” she asked Anne.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
“Of course it is a long time since we met. Do
you remember?”</p>

<p>Now she remembered: it was Martha Illey.</p>

<p>“The dancing lessons....”</p>

<p>These words set Anne’s eyebrows rigid and
hard. Martha Illey turned quickly sideways:
“Thomas!” and introduced her brother.</p>

<p>Anne saw a refined manly hand in the sun. It
wore an old-fashioned seal ring with a green
stone. She looked up, but the man’s face seemed
quite strange to her. Then the recollection of
her solitary meditations vibrated through her
and scared her. She felt that she was blushing.
Confusion passed over her countenance like a
cloud. It was already gone. Her charming
smile raised the corners of her mouth ironically.</p>

<p>Thomas Illey laughed too but did not look
quite sure of himself. The sun, reflected from
the water, trembled in his eyes. He turned to
Christopher.</p>

<p>“Your sister and I are not strangers to each
other. She caught me one day when I went out
of town in search of sunlight, sunshine, trees and
earth. Even then she made fun of me....”</p>

<p>Underneath the pier the ferryman landed.
Then the boat started with them towards the island.
Anne felt that all her troubles had remained
on shore and that she was light and free.
The little craft floated in molten gold and the
oars stirred up gold too. And while the water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
carried her, it also carried her thoughts away
through its wonderful glitter.</p>

<p>“I like to hear the Danube,” said Martha Illey.
“Do you remember, Tom? We used to listen
to it at home. It murmurs just like the woods of
Ille.”</p>

<p>“I too love the Danube,” said Anne’s veiled
voice. “My ancestors come from somewhere
near its sources. From the great forests....”</p>

<p>Christopher thought uncomfortably of woodcutters
and, embarrassed, kicked his sister to stop
her from saying any more.</p>

<p>Anne smiled.</p>

<p>“They came thence, down on the banks of the
river, as if the Danube had called them.” She
reflected for an instant and then added quietly:
“I have never yet heard the murmur of forests.
It seems to me that the river sings something.
Always the same thing and when it comes to the
end of its song nobody can remember the beginning.”</p>

<p>Christopher looked attentively at the cut of
Illey’s clothes. Where did his tailor live?
Then he observed his narrow shoes and hid his
own feet under the seat. He began to copy
Illey’s gestures carefully. He also imitated the
modulation of his voice. He seemed so confident
of himself and so distinguished.</p>

<p>Illey looked over the water while he spoke:</p>

<p>“Who knows why this river is called the Blue
Danube? It does not carry the sky but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
earth. How it turns up the soil and takes its
greenish-yellow colour from it....” He leant
over the side of the little boat; the water splashed
up against the boat’s prow. “It reminds you of
the murmur of forests and of music,” he said
smilingly, “to me it sounds like cattle drinking.”</p>

<p>“Cattle?” Anne could not help laughing.</p>

<p>They reached the island. The ferryman
caught hold of the bough of a willow. The keel
of the boat slid creaking into the gravelly shore.</p>

<p>The drooping twigs brushed Anne’s face.
She caught at them with her mouth and a green
leaf remained between her teeth.</p>

<p>From the noisy, active brilliance of the river
they entered moist green quietude. The grass
was high and soft, the trees drooped low; and
under them, in the dense shade, winged flakes of
silver floated. Like a small, buzzing bell of gold,
a wild bee flew up into the air.</p>

<p>“We shall have to look for the others,” said
Anne to her brother. She became suddenly dispirited.</p>

<p>Christopher made a wry face. Martha insisted.</p>

<p>“Let us remain together,” said Thomas Illey.
His voice had nothing unusual in it, yet it had
an effect on Anne as if it caught hold of her and
held her back. Now nobody thought any more
of separation. Moss yielded softly under their
feet. The boughs, like waves, opened and shut
up again behind them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>“As if we walked at the bottom of a green
lake....”</p>

<p>“The shade, too, is as cool as water.”</p>

<p>“This year summer was late. We had to wait
a long time for it.”</p>

<p>“Ever so long. But now it has come at
last.”</p>

<p>“It has come....” Anne said nothing more
and looked suddenly sideways at Illey. She felt
uneasy. He seemed again quite strange to her.
He whom she had seen in the glen behind the
cemetery had been handsomer and more attractive.
Thomas Illey’s sharp, lean face gave the
lie to her memory.</p>

<p>The trees became sparser. They came to a
meadow. Illey took his hat off. The sun shone
on his face.</p>

<p>Anne stopped, her eyes became large and blue
as if filled to the brim with the sky and her memory
melted for one instant into reality. Now
she could not understand how it had been possible
for her to think that Illey had been changed by
her imagination. He was his own self ... exactly
like the one she had not forgotten. His
dark hair shone. His noble head curved in a fine
line into his neck, like a thoroughbred’s. Anne’s
eyes caressed him timidly. That was not the
broad muscular nape of the Ulwings. The lords
of Ille had never carried heavy loads.</p>

<p>She saw what she had believed was lost. And
as she passed by his side, she felt as if a ripple of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
trembling, happy laughter pervaded her and rose
to her lips and filled her eyes.</p>

<p>The restraint in her melted away. After all,
they had known each other for a long time. They
had so much to tell each other.</p>

<p>Thomas Illey also talked more freely.</p>

<p>Anne learned that his parents were no longer
living; that he was born down south on the
banks of the Danube, on the lands of Ille. Far
away, in a big country house where one’s footsteps
echoed under old portraits. The garden
looked in through the windows. One could hear
the Danube and, in autumn mists, the horn of
the chase. In the tillage silver-white oxen with
wide horns, behind them farmer serfs of Ille as
if all had risen from the furrow.</p>

<p>All this was foreign and curious to Anne, but
she liked to listen to Illey’s voice. Only gradually
did she begin to feel that what he talked
about absorbed him entirely as if it dragged him
away from her side on the shady path. If that
were true! If he really happened to go away!
She asked him spontaneously;</p>

<p>“But you will come back from there again?”</p>

<p>“Come back?” The man stopped for an instant.
The glitter died away in his eyes. “I can
go there no more. Ille has ceased to be ours.”</p>

<p>Anne scarcely heard him. She knew only that
he would not go away, that he would stay here.
Illey smiled again. He smiled in a queer, painful
way. The girl noticed this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>“What is the matter? Nothing.... Why
do I ask? I thought a twig had hit you.”</p>

<p>“Trees won’t hurt me.”</p>

<p>He spoke of the oaks of Ille. They stood in
front of the house. They soughed in the wind.
They told each other something that the children
could not understand, just like the grown-ups
when they talked Latin in the drawing-room.
Beyond the gate of the courtyard, a row of poplars
swayed in the wind. The poplars moved
like plumes. At the bottom of the garden there
was a cherry tree with a swing on it. The ropes
had cut into the bark of a branch and left their
mark forever.</p>

<p>The face of Thomas Illey became younger as
he spoke. He looked at Anne.</p>

<p>“In the glen where we first met, there is a
cherry tree too and it resembles the one with the
swing. Here is another.”</p>

<p>He pointed to a tree with his stick.</p>

<p>Till then they had apparently been eager to
speak, as if wanting to keep in touch though their
ways had been wide apart. Now, however, their
voices failed; they had reached the present. The
dense bushes hid the other two from their sight.
They perceived that they were alone.</p>

<p>The island was silent, as if spell-bound. And
in the spell their looks met timidly.</p>

<p>Time rested for an instant, then continued its
flight.</p>

<p>The laughing face of Martha Illey peeped out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
of the dense leaves. She waved a bunch of wild
flowers over her head. Christopher had picked
them for her and she had arranged them so deftly
that the very fields could not have done better.</p>

<p>Anne looked at the nosegay. Then she cast
her eyes down on her bosom: she would have liked
to wear a nosegay there, to take it home ... but
Thomas Illey gave her no flowers.</p>

<p>Around them the bushes entangled themselves
into an impenetrable wilderness. The path became
mossy, reached some steps and disappeared.
Beneath, the worn-out centuries-old stairs; in the
overgrown hollow, gentle sacred ruins. Among
the stones a gothic window. Green, cold church
walls; the ancient monastery of St. Margaret.</p>

<p>A low-flying bird was startled out of the princess’s
cell. From the road along the water voices
became audible. There were people beyond the
ruins.</p>

<p>Anne recognised the chocolate-coloured umbrella
of Mrs. Müller, the chemist’s wife. It
was an umbrella with a spring and was now tilted
to the side like a round fan. The old-fashioned
beaver of Gárdos, the proto-medicus, was visible
too. So was Mrs. Gál’s chequered shawl and the
Miss Münsters’ forget-me-not hats.</p>

<p>“There they are!” said Anne. Christopher
caught hold of her arm and pulled her back.</p>

<p>On the road the excursionists walked in
couples, panting, hot, as if doing hard work.</p>

<p>Next to Ignace Hold his wife walked tired and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
weary. Sophie had become ugly. Only her
eyes were like of old, those beautiful soft eyes.</p>

<p>Christopher looked after her for a long time.</p>

<p>The side whiskers of the chemist floated in the
breeze from the river. Mrs. Ferdinand Müller
was holding forth on the prospects of the camomile
crops. Little hunchback Gál, the mercenary
wine-merchant, complained that less wine
was consumed now in Pest than of old.</p>

<p>“I want drunkards!” he shouted, and laughed
at his sally.</p>

<p>Behind them two shop assistants carried a
basket. Long-necked bottles protruded from it.</p>

<p>Anne looked at Thomas Illey. She was struck
by his height and proportions. His face seemed
elegant in its narrowness. She felt drawn towards
him.</p>

<p>“Let us go after them,” she said in a whisper,
as if to appease her conscience.</p>

<p>“Later on....” Christopher laughed and
went in the opposite direction. He began to
talk of Art. He said he would like to be a
painter. He would paint a landscape, a wood.
A fire would burn under the trees and in the
flames small, red-bodied fairies would sway. He
would also paint a high, white castle. On the
top of a mountain, a high, solitary mountain.
On the bastion a white woman with shaded eyes
would stand, her hair alone would be black and
float in the wind like a standard. He changed
his subject suddenly. He spoke of music: of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
Bach and Mozart. Cleverly he managed to remain
in his depth; then he started whistling the
tune of a <i>valse</i>, gently, sweetly. He casually
mentioned that it was his own composition.</p>

<p>He also spoke of travels, though he had never
made a journey, of architecture, of books he had
never read, laughing in between with childish
boisterous laughter.</p>

<p>Anne looked upon him as if he were a conjurer.
How amiable he could be when he wanted to, and
for the moment she saw in him the Christopher
of old, with his fair hair shining like silver, and
his pale face.</p>

<p>Then again Thomas Illey alone was near
Anne. At the upper point of the island it felt
like standing on an anchored ship. In front of
them a narrow pebbly strip of land, cutting the
stream in two. The river split. It ran down
gurgling on both sides. Suddenly the water
stopped and the island began to move. The
island had weighed anchor ... the ship started
carrying them towards the shoreless Infinite.</p>

<p>The sun sank behind the hills. Anne started
and gazed after it.</p>

<p>“It is going....”</p>

<p>On the cool, glasslike sky the silver sickle of
the new moon appeared.</p>

<p>They turned back, but they searched in vain
for the excursionists. Near the farm scraps of
paper and empty long-necked bottles lay on the
downtrodden lawn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>The ferryman was waiting for them among
the boughs. Christopher was tired, weary of the
rôle he had supported so long. He knew now
that he could do the trick if such were his pleasure.
The magic of the ancient name of Illey
had worn off; he ceased to be impressed by the
fact that a bearer of it had once been Assistant
Viceroy and talking to Illey gave him no more
satisfaction than talking to any of his usual club
friends.</p>

<p>Since they had got into the boat, Anne too
had become silent. It was the evening of a holiday
and to-morrow would be a workaday
again.... The bright smile died off her lips.
She glanced back to the receding island and,
taking her gloves off, put a hand into the water
as if to caress the river. The ripple lapped at
her hand.</p>

<p>Illey sat on the prow and looked into the water.
In the faint, silvery moonlight the rings glittered
on Anne’s bony, boyish little hands. A sapphire:
a blue spark; a ruby: a drop of blood.
The river could not wash them off the girl’s
finger.</p>

<p>“How the current draws,” said Anne. Half
unconsciously Illey also touched the water.
And the Danube, the common master of the destinies
of remote German forests and great Hungarian
plains, seemed for an instant to try and
sweep the hands of their children together.</p>

<p>The boat reached the shore.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The old house was in flower. Never before
had so many roses blossomed in the
garden. Anne wanted it so. She carried
the flowers into the house and went,
faintly smiling, from room to room. She looked
at every object curiously as if she were seeing it
for the first time. The furniture, the pictures,
they all seemed different now; she looked at
them with different eyes, with the eyes of one
for whom she waited. Had not somebody said
to her the other day, on the pier of the Danube,
“Au revoir....”</p>

<p>Since then she had not met Thomas Illey.
And yet she had never taken so many walks with
Mamsell Tini. Sometimes she was quite tired
and still she wanted to go on, towards the pier
on the Danube, through the inner town. A
clean-cut profile behind the window of a carriage
rumbling by: her heart rose. But no, it was another
mistake. A slender form near the corner;
when it came nearer it was a stranger.</p>

<p>The days grew hot, the nights were close.</p>

<p>A window of the Ulwing’s house opened softly
in the moist early morning. The shadows were
still deep on the front. Opposite, sunlight was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
streaming golden over the castle hill, as if it shone
through a window of amber.</p>

<p>Anne leaned out into the clear sunrise. She
looked towards the island. When she turned
back again the rays of the yellow morning sun
had reached the bottom of the hill and came floating
across the Danube.</p>

<p>Steps approached. Tramping boots, the slap-slap
of naked feet. At the corner a three-storied
building was under construction. The name of
an unknown contractor hung from the scaffolding.
Shouts, hammering.... On the other side
of the street another new house. That was built
by the Ulwings, but it made slow progress.
Many houses.... Workmen poured into the
town from the countryside. The streets were
loud with <i>patois</i> talk. The old, fair, German
citizens seemed to have disappeared.</p>

<p>A peasant girl in a bright-coloured petticoat
passed under the window beside a mason. The
ample petticoat rustled pleasantly in unison with
the heavy footsteps of the man. Anne looked
after them. “Lucky people, they are together!”
She thought of herself and remembered a dream.
She had dreamt it last night, though she had
imagined that she had not slept at all.</p>

<p>In her dream she walked a strange street by
herself. That was unusual and frightened her.
Only one person was visible in the deserted street,
at the far end of it. She recognised him by his
elegant, careless gait. She followed him, faster<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
and faster, but the distance between them remained
the same.</p>

<p>The street began to stretch and become longer
and longer.</p>

<p>And he looked quite small, far, far away. She
could not reach him though by now she was running
breathlessly. She wanted to shout to him
to stop, stretching her arms out after him.</p>

<p>She awoke. The dream had vanished, but in
her heart there remained the longing, urgent
movement of her outstretched arms.</p>

<p>She looked at the portrait of her mother. Her
mother was no longer older than she; they were
now of the same age, she and the scared-looking
child-woman. She had outlived her mother’s
years. If she were here.... No, not even to
her could she speak of this, to nobody, never.</p>

<p>She threw herself on to the couch and covered
her face with her hands. With half-shut eyes,
she stared at the flowered linen cover. It began
to spread round her. It was linen no longer; it
became a meadow, a meadow all covered with
flowers and someone was coming towards her
from the other end. She did not turn in his
direction, yet she knew that he was coming. Her
heart beat violently. She raised her head in astonishment.
Everything was new, she herself
was new. All of a sudden she felt a desire to
sing, sing out to the sunshine of something that
was greater than she, too great to be retained in
her bosom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>To sing.... But the house was asleep. She
alone was awake. That was delightful ... to
be alone. She felt an irrepressible smile on her
lips. “I love him ...” she whispered it softly,
but she felt as though in these words she had
sung all her songs.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Downstairs the side entrance creaked gently.
Christopher had just come home. He looked
round and then stole into the office, into the
room where his father used to work in the master-builder’s
life time. Since Christopher had
somehow managed to pass through the technical
school, that was his place. Worn out, he
leaned his elbows on the writing-table. His
shirt was crushed and his face looked crushed
too.</p>

<p>Otto Füger came in to him, but he was unable
to alter his despairing attitude. Helplessly his
mouth went sideways.</p>

<p>“What has happened?” asked the younger
Füger.</p>

<p>Christopher looked up wearily. It was all
the same to him who questioned him and what
he answered. At this moment he would have
confessed his misery even to Florian. He had
to speak to somebody ... it is a relief to speak.</p>

<p>The straight soft lips of Otto Füger’s mouth
went wide apart. His eyes became round. He
had long suspected that Christopher gambled.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
But what he had lost last night was more
than he thought possible. Too much.... He
steadied his staring features. He wanted to
know all there was to know.</p>

<p>“Is that all the trouble?”</p>

<p>Christopher looked at him suspiciously. He
expected reproaches. That was what he wanted;
that would have shamed him, appeased him. It
would have relieved him of the weight of responsibility.
Otto Füger felt that he had been tactless.
He put on a serious, worried expression.</p>

<p>“This is a misfortune. A great misfortune.
If the late Mr. Ulwing knew...!”</p>

<p>Yet, he could have said nothing more crushing.
Christopher bent his head.</p>

<p>“Don’t think ... I am not bad. I am only
unlucky, damned unlucky.”</p>

<p>Young Füger walked up and down the room
and seemed deep in thought though he knew
full well what he was going to say.</p>

<p>Christopher’s eyes followed his movements
with painful attention.</p>

<p>“Help me,” he said hoarsely when silence became
insufferable. “Help me, for God’s sake;
give me some advice.”</p>

<p>That was exactly what Otto Füger wanted.
He looked round cautiously, then stopped in
front of his chief’s son.</p>

<p>“The name of Ulwing is good,” he whispered,
“in Paternoster Street they will lend on it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
whatever you want. What are letters of exchange
for? Of course, it’s wrong,” he added
hastily, “but for once....”</p>

<p>“In Paternoster Street, at the money
changer’s?” Christopher looked up a little.
“And my simple signature is sufficient? How
is it I never thought of it! Shall I go there?”</p>

<p>When Otto Füger was left alone, he took his
spectacles off, breathed on them and while he
wiped them kept them quite close to his eyes.
He sat down to the writing-table. Slowly he
began to draw on the blotter. First he drew
flourishes which became by degrees the letter U
... Ulwing &amp; Co. These were the words he
wrote finally and he thought that he would be the
Co. He would work, but no more in the dark,
no more for others, like Augustus Füger, for
whom he felt an intimate contempt. His father
had the nature of an old-fashioned servant, who
grows old in the yoke, remains a beggar for ever
and works for another man’s pocket.</p>

<p>He effaced what he had written on the blotter
and got up respectfully from the table. John
Hubert was crossing the room. The head of the
firm waved his hand amicably. Otto Füger
wrinkled his eyebrows. “What an old hand he
has. The whole man is old. Won’t last long.”
And he looked after him with the slow, strangled
hatred that is only felt by the poor who have to
sell their brains to enrich the rich.</p>

<p>“He can’t last long. And the other?...”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
He started anew writing on the pad. Ulwing
&amp; Co. He wrote it many times and erased it
carefully.</p>

<p>That afternoon Christopher brought Anne a
small gold chain. He bought Mamsell Tini a
silver-plated statue of St. Anthony, gave Florian
some money and sent him to the circus. He was
generous and whistled happily.</p>

<p>At the money changers’ in Paternoster Street
everybody bowed respectfully when he mentioned
that his name was Christopher Ulwing. They
never asked for any security, nor did they make
any enquiries. The pen trembled slightly between
his fingers, but the owl-faced little clerk
who presented the bill of exchange never noticed
it.</p>

<p>Now he was going to pay all his debts. He
began to count. How much would there be left
over? He owed money to two usurers in King
Street. He would take his watch out of pawn.
He thought of the suspicious old hag who waited
for nightfall to open her door at the bottom of
the courtyard of a disreputable house. He had
promised a bracelet to a girl. Greater sums began
to come to his mind. Many old debts he
had forgotten. He whistled no more. He
tried to suppress the unpleasant thoughts; they
had no justification, for had he not plenty of
money in his pocket? Somehow he would manage
to get his house in order. As for cards, he
would never touch them again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>Then he stared wearily into space; he felt irritated.
He had lost all faith in his own pledges.
He had broken as many promises as he had made.
He must pledge his word to somebody else.
Where was Anne?</p>

<p>Anne stood outside near the stairs and, leaning
against the balustrade, looked into the porch.
She did not change her attitude when her brother
stepped beside her.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?” asked Christopher
to attract her attention. He needed her, he
wanted to speak to her. Now, at once, because
later on he might not have the courage to do so.</p>

<p>“Anne....”</p>

<p>The young girl turned round, but her look
strayed beyond him.</p>

<p>“Somebody has come, the front door bell
rang.” At this moment she lived her own life
so intently that her heart could not hear the silent
cry for help of the other life.</p>

<p>Christopher stopped near her for a little while,
then he gave a short whistle. The moment when
he had decided to open his heart had passed. He
was rather pleased that he had not tied himself
with embarrassing promises. He remained
free.</p>

<p>Anne scarcely noticed when he left her. She
leaned again over the balustrade. The corners
of her eyes and lips rose imperceptibly. Her
small face took on a strange expectant expression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>

<p>And on that day he for whom Anne had waited
really came.</p>

<p>They sat in the sunshine room, stiff, in a polite
circle, as if a hoop were on the ground between
them.</p>

<p>Thomas Illey had brought his sister with him.
Christopher was also there and Anne imagined
that they must all necessarily notice her panting
breath, and the blood forever rising to her cheeks.</p>

<p>She began to observe herself carefully, but
found her voice natural, her movements regular,
as if someone else acted for her. She grew calm;
the confused sounds in her head turned into
words. Thomas Illey’s voice became distinct
from the others and reached her like a touch.</p>

<p>It gave her a tremor. It attracted her irresistibly,
she had to turn her face to him. Illey’s
eyes were shining and deep. Only for an instant
did he look so, then he seemed to make an
effort and a cloud of haughty reserve fell over
the radiant warmth of his look, concealing it from
the rest of the world.</p>

<p>But Anne did not forget that look, when her
father came up from his office. Thomas Illey
spoke to John Hubert only, who sat just as
solemnly on the thin-legged flowered chair as
he did long ago besides the Septemvir Bajmoczy
in the drawing-room of Baroness Geramb.</p>

<p>They spoke of the city. Of new railways.
Steamers for the Danube. Building. Politics.</p>

<p>Anne did not understand much of this. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
the Ulwing family national politics only meant
a good or bad business year. They were considered
a means or an obstruction, whereas to
Illey they seemed interesting for their own sake.</p>

<p>His sparse, tense speech became voluble.</p>

<p>“In vain they trample on us, in vain they
throttle us,” he said and his expression became
hard. “The great freedom of the nomads is the
ancestral home of my race. We sprang from
that. It cannot be forgotten....”</p>

<p>Anne looked at him intensely and while she
listened distant memories came slowly from the
twilight of her mind. Grandfather Jörg’s former
shop, feverish men and the mysterious powerful
voice which, unintelligible, had once carried
her soul for a cause she could not understand.
Now it seemed to her that Thomas Illey gave
words to the voice and that she began to understand
events of her childhood.</p>

<p>John Hubert too followed Illey’s word attentively
and thought of his father, Ulwing the
builder. What he had done and felt for the
town, Illey felt for the country and would like
to do for the whole country. How was that
possible?</p>

<p>He smiled soberly. “They are all the same,
the Hungarian gentry. Every one of them
wants to save the whole country, yet if each of
them grappled with a small part of it, they
would achieve more.” He criticised his guest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
quietly within himself, yet listened to him with
pleasure, because his words roused confidence
and his thoughts could find support in the power
of words.</p>

<p>“Do you really think it is possible that our
economic life should ever revive again?” John
Hubert was now thinking of his business only.
He spoke of the price of timber, building material
and labour conditions.</p>

<p>Martha smiled absent-mindedly in the corner
of the flowered couch. Christopher interrupted
nervously but his father did not heed him.</p>

<p>Thomas Illey listened politely. Anne noticed
that he glanced towards the mantelpiece, at the
clock under the glass globe. Frightened, she
followed his look. She had never yet seen the
hand run so mischievously fast. And she now
had a foreboding of what the hours were to be
to her when she was without him.</p>

<p>She must say something to Illey before he
went, something that would bring him back
again. She did not know that she got up, she
did not know that she went to the piano.</p>

<p>“Yes, sing something,” said Martha.</p>

<p>“Do sing!” cried Christopher, delighted to interrupt
his father.</p>

<p>Anne glanced shyly at Illey. He looked imploringly.
Their eyes met. They were far
from each other and yet the girl felt that she was
nearest to him and was going to say something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
to him, to him alone. She did not know what.
But under her hand Schubert’s music was already
rising from the piano.</p>

<p>“Greetings to thee, greetings to thee....”</p>

<p>Blood rose in a pale pink cloud to Anne’s temples.
Her face became radiantly beautiful, her
pure youthful bosom rose and fell like a pair
of snowy, beating wings and her voice sounded
clearly, rapturously, like a deep, all-powerful
passion. It expressed tears, triumphant youth,
the unconscious, glorious avowal of all her
love.</p>

<p>Christopher looked at her in amazement. He
had never heard his sober, serious sister sing like
that. All looked at Anne. Not one of them
understood what had happened, yet they felt a
strange warm light thrill through them.</p>

<p>“How beautiful she looks when she is singing!”
thought Thomas Illey.</p>

<p>People do not see each other always, only now
and then for a moment. Thomas Illey saw Anne
in this moment. He turned a little pale and felt
as if a hot caressing hand fanned the air near
his face. He lost control over his eyes and passionately
they took possession of the girl.</p>

<p>Though Anne did not understand all that was
in this look, it moved her deeply.</p>

<p>Then the song came to an end. The following
silence cooled Anne’s soul. Her greenish
blue eyes looked frigidly into the air, her eyelids
became immobile. When she turned to Illey her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
face was reserved, impenetrable. She wanted to
screen what she had shown of herself, as if she
were ashamed of it.</p>

<p>The others too assumed this ordinary expression.
Everybody returned to everyday soberness.
Netti brought the lamp in. It was evening.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Before the week was over Thomas Illey called
again at the old house. He came alone, Martha
had gone into the country.</p>

<p>“To the mother of her fiancé,” said Illey.
“It is an old engagement. The wedding will be
in autumn. Then that worry will be over too.”</p>

<p>He said no more about it. On the whole he
spoke little. Nor did Anne say much, but the
silence between them was bright and happy.</p>

<p>Tini’s knitting needles clattered rapidly underneath
the lamp-shade; and the expression of her
long, stiff face was that of an elderly person contemplating
spring through the window.</p>

<p>Now and then Anne started, as if his look had
called to her by name. She smiled at Thomas
over the embroidery screen, then bent her head
down again and the stones of her rings sparkled
at regular intervals as she drew the silk upwards.</p>

<p>John Hubert came up from the office. Mamsell
Tini stuck her knitting needles into the ball
of wool. She got up. Her steps died away in
the corridor and John Hubert spoke again about
business, the town and building.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>When this happened Anne began to hear the
ticking of the clock. If only once she could be
alone with Thomas, she would go to the clock,
push its hand back and that would tell him all
she dared not express in words. But they were
never alone. She could only speak to him when
she was singing.</p>

<p>Did he understand it? Did he like to hear it?
She did not know. Illey was different from everyone
she had known hitherto. When their
eyes met in silence she felt herself quite near
to him. When they spoke to each other it
seemed to her that they were far, far apart and
that their voices had to travel a great distance,
the words being dulled on the way.</p>

<p>Anne began to grow fond of silence which she
could fill with the warmth of her heart.</p>

<p>Summer passed away.</p>

<p>Thomas Illey came more and more frequently
and stayed longer and longer. John Hubert
surrendered his evening stroll to remain in his
company. Tini produced the best china cups
from the glass cupboard when he was expected.
Florian ran to open the door.</p>

<p>The days became shorter. Now and then
Netti lit a fire in the stove.</p>

<p>One evening Illey was even more taciturn than
usual.</p>

<p>Tini dropped her ball of wool. While she
bent down for it Thomas turned suddenly to
Anne and said in a very low whisper:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>“I shall soon leave Pest. Give me a word that
I can carry with me.”</p>

<p>Mamsell was now sitting up again, stiff and
straight, on her chair and her knitting needles
knocked each other diligently.</p>

<p>Anne’s hand had slid down from the embroidery
frame and her eyes became dull as if all their
lustre had melted away.</p>

<p>“You are going?” Her voice was very dim.</p>

<p>“What did you say?” asked Miss Tini, absent-mindedly.
She stuck one of the knitting needles
sideways into the knot of her hair and began to
count the stitches.</p>

<p>Illey watched with silent despair the slow-moving
lips of Mamsell as he impatiently twirled the
old seal ring round and round.</p>

<p>“I am going to Martha’s wedding. I have
some other business too, so who knows when I
can come back again.”</p>

<p>Anne looked at the ring and then lifted her
eyes to Thomas. She would have liked to tell
him, implore him, to take her with him too, to
abide faithfully by her as he clung to that ring
and never leave her alone again.</p>

<p>“Come to-morrow with Christopher to the
Palatine’s Island,” said Illey suddenly. His
voice became harsh and commanding. “We
shall meet at the pier.” Then he continued, more
softly: “Do sing something....” He said
this as if to clear the air of the grating vibrations
of his former words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>“You really want me to?” Anne’s eyes
blazed up. The dominating voice had made her
feel as though Thomas had laid hands on her,
as though he had bent her wrist with tender
force. That unconscious delight of women in
the humiliations of love flashed through her.
She blushed and asked:</p>

<p>“What do you like? Schubert, Mozart or
Schumann?”</p>

<p>“The voice of Anne Ulwing,” answered Illey
simply, looking straight into her eyes.</p>

<p>When the song died away, Thomas rose.</p>

<p>“Au revoir,” said Anne, and her hand, like a
little bird snuggling up in its nest, took refuge
in his strong, warm grip. They remained like
that for an instant. Then Anne was again alone.
She ran back to the piano.</p>

<p>Even now she was still singing for Thomas.
She sent her voice after him, to follow him down
the stairs, to attend him part of the way. Perhaps
he would hear it and turn back.</p>

<p>She drew aside the muslin curtains of the window.
Lamps were already burning in the
streets. Someone on the other side. Anne
leant eagerly forward.</p>

<p>It was Otto Füger.</p>

<p>For a short time the younger Füger remained
standing there, and turned his head in the direction
whither Thomas Illey had gone.</p>

<p>From the office window a beam of light
stretched to the street. In what had once been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
the study of Ulwing the builder the green-shaded
lamps were lit up.</p>

<p>This evening John Hubert remained exceptionally
long at his writing desk. He sat there
in a state of collapse and his colourless skin
formed two empty folds under his chin. His
hand lay inert on a bundle of papers which had
been presented to him for signature.</p>

<p>He rose heavily. He was looking for the
second time through the door which led to the
adjoining office. Once Augustus Füger used to
work there, but, since an attack of apoplexy had
paralysed the little book-keeper’s right arm, his
son Otto occupied his place.</p>

<p>“Where can he be?” mused John Hubert, looking
through the door into the empty office.</p>

<p>He returned to his seat at the writing desk.
His eyes gazed at the plan of Pest-Buda, but
he did not see anything of it. Every now and
then his head twitched, as if he sought to shake
up behind his forehead the dull, dense matter
that refused to act. He sighed and desisted
from the effort. He shut his eyes. But now
that he wanted to rest, his brain became active
and a whirling chaos moved about it. He
thought suddenly of Christopher.</p>

<p>Otto Füger entered quietly through the door.
Cold rage was in his eye and his lips were compressed
and straight. But as soon as he came
within the light of the lamps he was already
smiling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span></p>

<p>John Hubert continued his reflections aloud:</p>

<p>“Somebody mentioned Christopher’s name to-day
at the money-changer’s. The clerk spoke of
him behind the counter. When I turned to them
they caught their breath. I can’t understand it.”
He looked anxiously at young Füger. “Do you
know anything?”</p>

<p>Otto Füger did not answer at once. At this
moment he hated furiously everybody living in
that house. He hated the others because of
Anne and on account of that stuck-up Illey
whose looks always passed above his head. Now
he had his chance to revenge himself on them for
having been born in the back-lodgings of an insignificant
book-keeper, for being poor and
striving vainly. He looked humbly to the
ground and feigned to suffer from the painful
necessity of his disclosures.</p>

<p>“It is hard on me to have to betray Mr. Christopher.
I have always tried to restrain him, I
have implored him....”</p>

<p>“What is going on behind my back?” John
Hubert’s voice bubbled out heavily between his
blanched lips.</p>

<p>When the whole truth was revealed to him, he
repeated painfully:</p>

<p>“He gambles ... the whole town knows it....
He loses ... bills of exchange?...”
He asked terrified: “What is the amount?”</p>

<p>“One hundred and eighty thousand
florins....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>For an instant, John Hubert straightened
himself in the chair, then his body collapsed
slowly to one side. His high collar alone kept
his relaxed, waxy face in position. In a few
minutes he had turned quite old.</p>

<p>Otto Füger watched his chief cunningly. He
judged from his altered attitude what was the
right thing to say.</p>

<p>“We must not despair, sir. At bottom Mr.
Christopher is a good, God-fearing young gentleman.
It is all the fault of bad company. I
always told him so. Those young gentry fellows
from the country preyed on him. They have
got rich Ulwing’s money. But don’t punish him,
sir. I beg of you, let me bear your anger, for
have I not sinned more than he for keeping
it quiet?”</p>

<p>He hung his head penitently, as if expecting
judgment.</p>

<p>“You are a good fellow, Otto,” said John Hubert,
deeply touched.</p>

<p>“We will save the reputation of the firm,”
young Füger said solemnly. “As for Mr. Christopher,
if I may venture to give advice, we shall
have to tear him from the tempters. Perhaps
abroad....”</p>

<p>“Send him abroad? Yes,” John Hubert became
suddenly determined. “That was once the
plan of my late father. You advise Frankfurt?
All right, let it be Frankfurt.”</p>

<p>The book-keeper had not expected to get his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
way so easily. He became more enterprising.</p>

<p>“He had better go among unpretentious working-class
people, till he settles down. Meanwhile
you might like to choose for Miss Anne
some level-headed business man as a husband; he
might enter the firm as a partner and relieve
your mind, sir, of all the worries.”</p>

<p>That was a new hope. John Hubert pulled
his necktie up. “A serious man of business to
stand by Christopher. Somebody belonging to
the family. Anne’s husband....” Thomas
Illey’s image intruded unpleasantly on his memory.
“We must prevent them from meeting
again.” Life had been so exacting to him that
now he would insist on getting his own back.
He had always been merciless to himself, now he
would show no mercy to others.</p>

<p>“Yes, that would free me from all care,” he
murmured as if taking counsel with himself.
“Anne’s husband.... But who is it to be?”</p>

<p>Otto Füger smiled modestly. He took his
spectacles off, breathed on them and wiped them
while holding them up to his left eye.</p>

<p>John Hubert, for reasons unknown to him,
thought of the son of Martin George Münster.
Charles Münster would bring capital into the
business, he had brains....</p>

<p>He clapped Otto Füger on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Thank you!”</p>

<p>Young Füger looked after him dejected. He
had expected something else.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>Next day Christopher left the old house. And
at the pier of the Danube Thomas Illey waited
in vain for Anne.</p>

<p>White frost fell over the autumn roses in the
garden.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Rain had collected in the gargoyle and
gave off a hopeless gurgle as if someone
were sobbing under the steep double
roof.</p>

<p>Out of doors the autumn evening fell sadly.
On the window panes of the sunshine room raindrops
ran down like tears on a transparent grey
face.</p>

<p>Silence reigned in the deserted old nursery.
Since Christopher’s departure Anne had been
very lonely. She would often rise from the work
table during the afternoon and go quietly to the
door. She opened it quickly, nobody was there.
She looked down into the depths of the staircase.
The house was silent. She decided to
count up to a hundred, then wait no longer.
Twice she counted up to a hundred, and even
after that she looked back from the threshold.</p>

<p>At night when Netti lit the lamp and Florian
bolted the front door, Anne’s eyes more than
once filled with tears. She felt a prisoner. Life
remained outside the walls of her prison. Again
a useless day had drawn to an end, that at its
dawning had promised so generously. It tortured
her artfully while it lasted, and in the end
achieved nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>Thomas Illey came no more.</p>

<p>Anne’s little face became quite pale and thin.
She began to be afraid. Perhaps Illey went to
someone else now, perhaps he was angry? The
last time he saw her he asked her so earnestly
to go the next day to the Danube pier. And
she could not go, could send no message, could
not write. Christopher had to leave and their
father was very strict with both of them.</p>

<p>“Why does he not come? Where is he?”</p>

<p>She pressed her face against the window pane.
Whenever the front door bell rang the blood
rushed to her heart. She waited, then hung her
head wearily.</p>

<p>In the sunshine room the furniture began to
whisper. The walls too remembered. The door
handle was familiar with Thomas’s hand. The
shaded lamp, the clock under the glass globe,
they all told her that they had seen him many
times.</p>

<p>Anne turned her face away. The memories
wounded her. She clasped her hands in prayer
for respite from her tortures.</p>

<p>Hours passed. Tini came in and started to
read her fortune with cards. “All your sorrows
will come to an end, my little dove,” she said
when she finished her game.</p>

<p>“I have no sorrows,” answered the girl and
tried to hold her head high.</p>

<p>John Hubert’s voice said:</p>

<p>“Anne, a visitor!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>Of late Charles Münster had often come to the
house. In the evening he sat comfortably in the
green room, approving everything John Hubert
said, and when he could think of nothing to say,
he carelessly twirled the thumbs of his big, red
hands.</p>

<p>Those hands annoyed Anne. They became
embarrassed, blushed like human faces, struggled,
while Charles Münster remained placid and
tedious in his inordinately long Sunday coat.</p>

<p>“Why does he come?” wondered Anne
wearily, while sitting opposite him.</p>

<p>One day she learned that too; Charles Münster
had asked her father for her hand.</p>

<p>“It is a very honourable proposal and very
advantageous,” said John Hubert to his
daughter. “The house of Münster has a good
reputation and is serious. The young man is intelligent
and owns some capital.”</p>

<p>Anne’s heart sank while she looked at him and
then the blood rushed to her face. All her life
she had striven to repress her will; she had always
obeyed, but what she was now asked to do roused
her to rebellion.</p>

<p>“No, never!” And her voice rang out like a
hammer dropping on steel.</p>

<p>John Hubert was startled. That was the
voice of Ulwing the builder.</p>

<p>“I spoke too soon,” he thought, vexed. “I
ought to have waited a little longer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>Then he waited. Outside the snow was falling
already.</p>

<p>In the next few weeks Anne’s face became
more and more transparent. She did not sleep
at night. She sang no longer, nor did she laugh
and during the long evenings she sat silent in
the green room, while her father worked at the
writing table with the innumerable drawers.</p>

<p>John Hubert had now to use spectacles for
reading. He pushed them up on his forehead
and looked stealthily at Anne. Gradually he
became anxious. He thought of his own life.
He had never been happy, had never made anybody
else happy.</p>

<p>“Are you ill?” he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Have you any pain?”</p>

<p>Anne did not answer but her eyes asked him
why he tortured her. John Hubert bent down.
He turned the pages of his ledger. Anne heard
him sigh anxiously.</p>

<p>“Have you had bad news from Christopher?”
she asked, going to the writing table. “No? Is
it the business?... Speak to me about it, for I
too am an Ulwing.”</p>

<p>John Hubert closed the book in which he had
been reckoning.</p>

<p>“You would not understand it.”</p>

<p>“But I could learn to....”</p>

<p>“You just go on embroidering, singing. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
have no need to know about business. It is not
suitable for women. God has created you for
other ends.” But this sentence aroused his conscience.
He became embarrassed.</p>

<p>“You have not yet forgotten Thomas Illey?”
he whispered casting his eyes down.</p>

<p>“I have not forgotten him.”</p>

<p>A few days later Grandfather Jörg came in
the evening to take Anne to a concert. In the
carriage the old gentleman began to mention
Charles Münster.</p>

<p>“Is he too like all the others?” the girl thought
and looked sadly at her grandfather. Once he
had been to prison for sympathizing with the
freedom of others; and now he spoke against his
grandchild’s freedom.</p>

<p>In the concert hall the crowd was already large.
Innumerable candles burned in the gilt wooden
chandelier. Their flames wove a peaceful yellow
light in the air. On the platform the piano
stood open. The orchestra was tuning up and
this sounded like birds with sharp beaks pecking
at the stringed instruments.</p>

<p>A few reporters stood near the wall. Anne
heard them agree in advance as to what they
would say in next day’s papers. In the stalls
well-known merchants from the inner town, wives
of rich citizens, officers in uniform, and right
in front bejeweled ladies in huge crinolines,
noble gentlemen in Hungarian national costume.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>The family of Müller the chemist nodded to
them. The Münster daughters were there too.
In the back rows the newcomers moved their
chairs. Some laughed and cleared their throats,
then suddenly, as if moved by a common spring,
all the heads turned towards the platform. Then
all became silent.</p>

<p>Anne glanced over the faces. The crowd
seemed to her like an empty vessel gaping towards
the piano in expectation of being filled
with sounds and emotions. Her heart was full
of her young distress and she felt afraid that at
the first sound her sufferings would overflow
through her eyes.</p>

<p>All of a sudden she became strangely restless,
as if some one had touched her from a distance.
She turned her head quickly. The blood
throbbed in her veins as her look met the dark,
sad eyes of Thomas Illey. And the two glances
united through space.</p>

<p>Waves surged between them. A wild tumult
of cheers broke out. The round of applause
echoed like a thunderstorm from the walls.</p>

<p>The great artist stood on the platform, high
above everybody. His long white hair waved
softly round his marble brow. He inclined his
wiry body before the homage.</p>

<p>Then the piano burst out under his hands.
And the sounds sang, crept, stormed furiously,
coaxed voluptuously, and dissolved in a smile.
The artist with the marble brow conjured up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
harmonies from the piano that had not existed
before him and were not to be after him.</p>

<p>The crowd listened with bated breath, spellbound.
And the music continued like a swelling
tide. Then it became tender like a dying echo.
It broke forth again with superb impetuosity.
Sounds wrought in fire rose and those who heard
them lived the creative moments of Beethoven,
Sebastian Bach and Weber over again. These
sublime moments were resuscitated by the master
whose playing was forever the begetting of
gods.</p>

<p>Anne Ulwing’s soul was carried on glowing
wings by Beethoven’s Appassionata to Thomas
over the heads of the crowd. She felt that the
waves of the music swept them together and that
they became swallowed up in some boundless
glittering veil.</p>

<p>The hall was delirious again. People stood
up. Some rushed to the platform and continued
to applaud there.</p>

<p>The artist began to play a composition of his
own. And then, as if his marble countenance
had been set aflame, fire shone on his brow, fire
streamed from his eyes and the creative artist
wandered and was alone by himself.</p>

<p>Anne turned towards the piano. This was
different from anything she had ever heard.
Long-forgotten words recurred to her mind:
“One has to create like God. Even the clay has
to be created anew.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>Applause rose again, but the clapping seemed
more restrained. It was addressed to the virtuoso,
not to the creator.</p>

<p>“They don’t understand him,” said Anne disappointed.</p>

<p>“It is not yet safe to admire this music. It
came too early ...” and again the words of
Adam Walter came to her mind.</p>

<p>Then everything was forgotten. Her eyes
searched for Thomas in the crowd thronging towards
the exit. In the dust-laden heat of the
cloak-room people pushed each other. Under
the porch the doors of the carriages slammed.
A hoarse voice shouted the names of the coachmen.</p>

<p>Anne saw Florian and made a sign to him.
Ulrich Jörg was already in the carriage.</p>

<p>“I should like to walk,” said the girl hurriedly.
The old gentleman was sleepy. The horses of
the next carriage became restive in the cold. The
door banged. Anne felt herself free.</p>

<p>“Let us go....”</p>

<p>Florian’s broad, good-natured face turned to
her for an instant in wonder. Then he followed
her obediently in the snow.</p>

<p>A motionless figure stood at the street corner
under a lamp peering into the windows of the
passing carriages. Suddenly he looked no longer
towards the carriages. His dark sad eyes rested
on Anne. He held his hat low in his hand and
snow fell on his thin face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>They clasped each other’s hands and the peace
of their mind was like the languid moment, still
incredible, when a bodily pain has abruptly
ceased to torture.</p>

<p>The sound of rolling carriages spread in all
directions. Occasional laughter flared up among
the human voices, dying away at a distance.
After that, only the snow was falling in slow,
shiny flakes. By tacit agreement they started,
side by side, into the great whiteness.</p>

<p>Anne did not feel the cold. The furs slid
down her bare shoulders and her low shoes sank
deep into the snow. Illey gazed at her in rapture,
then pulled himself together. He wanted
to appear calm, but his voice was strangely
changed.</p>

<p>“When I saw the posters of the concert, I began
to hope that we might meet. It all happened
more wonderfully than my wildest hopes.”</p>

<p>Anne too tried to control herself.</p>

<p>“So you really did not go for the music’s sake?”
she asked in a whisper, smiling.</p>

<p>“I never go to concerts,” said Illey candidly.
“I don’t understand the higher music.”</p>

<p>Anne turned to him anxiously:</p>

<p>“Then you did not understand what I sang to
you?”</p>

<p>“I did not understand the music, but I understood
her who produced it.”</p>

<p>Anne’s thought became confused. Till then
she had thought that they met, united in music....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
And now Thomas told her that he did not
understand the only language which her soul,
her blood could speak.... It did not matter,
nothing mattered so long as he was here, if only
he could be at her side.</p>

<p>She drew her head back a little and with eyes
half shut looked longingly at Illey’s shoulders as
though she would, by the intensity of her regard,
build a nest there for her little head.</p>

<p>Thomas began to walk at a noticeably slow
pace. Then Anne too noticed the snow-covered
lamp in front of the Ulwings’ house.</p>

<p>“I have sought this moment for a long
time,” said Illey quickly. “I was seeking it on
the island when I waited for you so long&mdash;till
the stars appeared and the ferryman lit a fire
for the night. Next day I was there too. I
have pulled the bell at your door many times. I
saw your face through the window, I heard you
play the piano, yet I was told you were not in.
Florian avoided my eyes when he said that. I
understood. It was not desired that I should
come.”</p>

<p>“And I was expecting you.” There was so
much suffering in Anne’s veiled voice that all
became clear to Illey.</p>

<p>At this moment they came in sight of the house.
They stepped so slowly that they remained practically
on the same spot, yet the distance grew
smaller. The porch moved out of the wall and
came to meet them rapidly, dark through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
glittering whiteness. The two pillar-men came
with it too. They leaned more and more from
under the cornice and looked down on them.</p>

<p>The porch stopped with a jerk. They had
reached the end of the street. Anne’s heart
stood still with anguish. One more moment and
they would be together no more.</p>

<p>Florian dropped the latch key. He fumbled
slowly, very slowly with his hand in the snow
and never looked up once while doing so.</p>

<p>Thomas Illey bent to Anne:</p>

<p>“We cannot live any more without each other,”
and he kissed her hand.</p>

<p>Snow was falling slowly and through the snow-white
veil they looked silently into each other’s
eyes.</p>

<p>When Anne walked up the stairs she took
Thomas’s kiss with her lips from her hand.</p>

<p>Next day she told her father all that had happened
and when in the afternoon the front door
bell rang Florian opened the door with a broad
beaming face to Thomas Illey.</p>

<p>Anne heard his steps. The steps passed her
door, along the corridor, towards the green room.</p>

<p>Thomas Illey spoke little. His voice was
serious and firm. John Hubert listened to him
standing and only offered him a seat when he had
finished.</p>

<p>“An honourable proposal....” This reminded
him that he had used the same words to
Charles Münster. He laughed and then spoke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
out conscientiously, as he had decided beforehand.
He spoke of the loss caused by the fire,
of bad years of business. Of Anne’s dowry.
His voice became feeble:</p>

<p>“I am very sorry but I cannot withdraw any
capital from the business. The estate must remain
undivided. This was decided by my late
father. I cannot depart from this.”</p>

<p>Illey waved his hand politely, disparagingly.</p>

<p>“This is not my affair. It concerns Miss Anne
alone.”</p>

<p>John Hubert stared at him with undisguised
astonishment. The charm of the ancient name
of Illey re-asserted itself on him: he no longer
leaned back in his armchair. He sat straight
up solemnly and felt sorry he had till now been
so business-like.</p>

<p>“But what about the property of Ille,” he chose
his words carefully, “I understand that it is, unfortunately,
in strange hands....”</p>

<p>Illey turned his head away. He realized that
he had just been showing off before the other and
felt ashamed. This mild-eyed good old business
man reminded him of that which had attracted
him at first to Anne. It was no good denying
it; in those times he thought that the Ulwings
were rich and that the ancestral property of Ille
might again become his own. He now tried to
justify himself for those old thoughts by the
longing for the land of his forebears. There
was one hope. He thrust it aside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>John Hubert looked at him expectantly.</p>

<p>“Did Mr. Illey not think of buying the property
back?”</p>

<p>Many a proud, disinterested word came to
Illey’s mind. To rise above everything, even
above himself. To ask for nothing, only for
Anne whom he loved. He turned his sharp
gentlemanly face to John Hubert. He looked
him straight in the eyes, as if making a vow:</p>

<p>“I think no longer of buying Ille back.”</p>

<p>John Hubert enquired politely after his family.</p>

<p>Thomas slowly turned the old seal ring on
his finger. He began to speak of his father.
He died young of heart disease. His mother
followed him. Then the property got into the
auctioneer’s hands. Only a swampy wood remained.
Nobody wanted that. And a little
money. He wanted to learn to work. This
brought him to town. He wanted to regain possession
of the land through his own exertions.
Had it not given them their name, or had it not
received its name from them? However it was,
the land of Ille and the Illeys had belonged to
each other for nearly a thousand years.</p>

<p>Thomas looked down wearily. He thought
that the fate of the Lord-Lieutenant’s grandchildren
had overtaken him too.</p>

<p>“I studied law,” he said quietly, “like the rest
of us; politics absorbed me and I did not learn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
to work for money. That is in our blood. It
is only when work is done gratuitously that the
Hungarian nobility does not blush to work.
Those of us who gave themselves for money became
bad men; the good ones were ruined.”</p>

<p>John Hubert nodded absent-mindedly. He
was quite reassured now that he had ascertained
that Thomas Illey did not intend to withdraw
Anne’s dowry from the business. He proffered
his hand to him.</p>

<p>“It is settled. You do not think of buying Ille
back. You won’t meddle with the business.
Now we can look at the ledgers and the balance
sheet.”</p>

<p>Thomas smiled. He wanted to see nothing
but Anne, and John Hubert opened the door of
the sunshine room to him. There everything was
bright and warm.</p>

<p>When the new spring made earth and sky
bright and warm around the old house, Mamsell
Tini stuck a wreathed veil into Anne’s hair.
Now, like a white cloud, the veil floated through
the old rooms, caressed the doors and walls.
Anne kissed her father.</p>

<p>“Thank you, father,” said the girl. “I am so
happy.”</p>

<p>Tears came into the eyes of John Hubert.
Life had no more joys in store for him....</p>

<p>In the corridor stood old Füger, and Mrs.
Henrietta in a starched bonnet, and Mr. Gemming.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
Poor little Feuerlein, deeply stirred,
wiped his eyes. None bowed more respectfully
to Thomas Illey than Otto Füger.</p>

<p>Above, high above the roofs, the bells clanged
loud from the church steeple of Leopold’s town,
bells that had so often spoken of the destinies of
the Ulwings. And under the porch the two pillar-men
looked down into the flower-laden carriage.</p>

<p>The porch repeated once over the sound of the
parting wheels, then the house fell into silence.
Anne carried her quiet laugh away with her on
her honeymoon. Everything became quiet, the
men, the days.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>John Hubert was quite alone. A letter from
Christopher, one from Anne. He read them
both many times over, smiled and shut his eyes.
Nowadays, he was always sleepy. He looked
at the clock. Too early to go to bed. He
walked up and down in the quiet rooms.</p>

<p>From the green room the light of the lamp
reached the dining room. The sunshine room
received light from a lamp in the street which
spread over the ceiling. The old nursery was
quite dark.</p>

<p>John Hubert folded his hands behind his back
and walked slowly from darkness into light, from
light into darkness. He thought of his life. It
had been like that too, but now that he looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
back on it there seemed to have been more darkness
than light.</p>

<p>He could not understand what made him think
of this just now when his head was weary enough.
For an instant he intended sending for the doctor.
Then he felt too tired to do it.</p>

<p>While he slowly turned the key in his watch,
he felt giddy, yet he put all the various objects
from his pocket into the alabaster tray. His
keys, his penknife and the cigar case embroidered
with beads. This he carried as a habit, having
renounced smoking several years ago.</p>

<p>Next day was Sunday. He did not get out
of bed. From time to time Tini came in to ask
if he wanted anything. He opened his eyes,
nodded, but said nothing.</p>

<p>Gárdos, the physician, reassured him.</p>

<p>“It will pass away; it is only a little overwork,”
and prescribed nux vomica.</p>

<p>“No, you must not write to the children.”</p>

<p>During the week John Hubert was up. On
Sunday he again stayed in bed and felt better
there. A letter came from Anne. He smiled
at it. So there was one person in the world who
owed him her happiness.... He smoothed his
blanket down and turned to the wall.</p>

<p>A loud buzzing woke him at night. His head
turned, the bed turned, so did the room. And
he breathed with difficulty. He wanted to unbutton
his shirt collar, but did not succeed. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
sat up suddenly and with his accustomed movement
put his hand several times to his neck as if
to put his necktie right.</p>

<p>Then he fell back and moved no more.</p>

<p>That night John Hubert Ulwing died, correctly,
without much ado, just as he had lived.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The house was empty and silence nestled
between its walls. It was a memorable
event for the corridor to hear the sound
of steps. The ticking of the marble
clock resounded through all the rooms, no noise
impeding its progress.</p>

<p>Thus did Anne find the house when she came
back with her husband from the interrupted journey
which was to remain in her memory like a
broken dream.</p>

<p>Days without thoughts. Gentle words.
Pure, girlish fears. Then she became accustomed
to Thomas’s embraces. The news of her
father’s death roused her and she could dream
her dream no more. It was gone for ever.
Another came.</p>

<p>Real life took its place and the first year
passed away.</p>

<p>Slowly the peace of the old house became
bright again. Now and then the rooms began to
laugh timidly. They stopped suddenly, ashamed
of themselves, as if remembering those who had
left by the door never to come back again.</p>

<p>Another year went by.</p>

<p>The yellow walls of the old house were warm
in the sun. In the garden the beds put forth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
blossom-laden rosebushes, climbing garlands of
roses.</p>

<p>The rooms now laughed freely with the rippling
laughter of a child. And the house smiled
to itself, like some good old patriarch who has
regained youth.</p>

<p>At that time Anne sang some wonderful little
songs. She had never learned them, they came
of themselves and their soothing rhythm was like
the rocking of a cradle. Then she lifted her
son with that mysterious movement, which is
more exalted than the gesture of love, a movement
secretly known by her arms long ago.
And she thought that it was this that linked all
humanity. An endless, blessed chain, a chain
wrought of women’s arms over the earth, beginning
with the first woman and to end with
the last child.</p>

<p>“Mamma,” babbled little George. Anne repeated
in whispers the word which was bestowed
on her, which she herself had never uttered to her
mother; she looked at the fading portrait of Mrs.
Christina. She began to listen. The street door
opened. Steps came along the corridor....</p>

<p>“Thomas, I was longing for you!” She would
have liked to say more, something warmer. She
wanted to tell him her love, but the words were
bashful and changed as they crossed her lips.
She leaned towards her husband, ready to be
kissed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>Illey did not notice it; he was thinking of something
else. He began to read a letter.</p>

<p>“From home....”</p>

<p>“From home?... Is not this your home?”
Anne’s head, held till now sideways in a listening
attitude, rose slowly.</p>

<p>Thomas saw nothing, heard nothing when Ille
was in question. Everybody, the old steward,
the bailiff, the agent, the priest, anybody who was
in difficulties, came to him, as if he were still the
landlord. He did their errands and his eyes
shone when he spoke of them.</p>

<p>Anne looked at him motionless. A feeling
came over her of which she could never rid herself
whenever Thomas spoke of Ille. It seemed
to her that her husband abandoned her and went
far away to some other place.</p>

<p>“Thomas,” she whispered, as if to recall him.</p>

<p>Illey smiled inattentively. He was still reading
the letter. Anne’s face became grave and
cold. The tenderness which had till then flowed
bootlessly from her shrank back painfully into
her heart.</p>

<p>“No, don’t go away. Come here. Read
this....”</p>

<p>But Anne would not go nearer him. She held
her head rigidly erect. After the vain inclination
to tenderness she hoped to regain the balance
in this way.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter, Thomas,” and animosity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
sounded in her voice, “after all I don’t know those
people of yours.”</p>

<p>“Why do you speak like that?” He looked
at her reproachfully. Again Anne’s voice baffled
the hope in his soul, with which he thought
of Ille, which still gained, against his will, the
upper hand over him.... If he were to tell
her everything, if he explained to her that everything
belonging to Ille was grown to his heart,
that he was craving for his land ... would she
understand? The words shaped themselves so
intensely in his mind that he nearly heard them
sound. But they seemed abasing, as if they were
begging. He felt that he could never utter them.</p>

<p>In that moment Anne saw her husband’s countenance
hard and frigid.</p>

<p>“Why are you angry, Thomas?” Her eyes
wandered to the letter from Ille. “Don’t you
understand? It will all be empty talk. All
this is so strange to me.”</p>

<p>“You are right!” Illey gave a short reproachful
laugh. It dawned on him suddenly that
Anne was strange to all that which lived so vividly
in his blood and his past. Strange, and perhaps
she wanted to remain so.</p>

<p>While they were silent it seemed to both of
them that they had drawn further apart from
each other, though neither of them had moved.
Then it was Thomas who turned away. Anne
looked after him.</p>

<p>In the beginning, when they could not understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
each other, they forgot it in an embrace.
Later on, the weak, helpless cry of a baby in the
next room was enough to remove everything from
their minds and to make them run to it side by
side; before they had reached the door they had
grasped each other’s hands.</p>

<p>On this occasion each of them remained alone.
The words he had spoken weighed cold on Anne’s
memory; those he had kept back made her anxious.
She played with her little son absent-mindedly.
She fumbled idly in her work-table’s
drawers. She gave that up too. She wanted
to go to her husband, lean her head against his
shoulders, and ask and answer till there remained
nothing between them that was obscure and uncertain.</p>

<p>But Thomas had visitors. From the green
room the voice of gentlemen reached the dining
room and the smoke of their pipes pervaded the
place. They talked of the reconciliation of the
King and the country, of the coronation, of those
who performed it, of Parliament, of great national
transformations.</p>

<p>Since the constitution had been re-established,
Illey had entered the service of the State; he
worked in the Ministry of Agriculture. Anne
heard him in the adjoining room make some remarks
on intensive culture.</p>

<p>How coolly and intelligently Thomas spoke,
while her own heart was still heavy and sore.
Suddenly her husband’s laughter reached her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
ears through the closed door. Her eyebrows
stiffened and straightened, as if she had been
hurt....</p>

<p>It was about this time that Thomas Illey began
to go shooting more often. His friends
who owned property in the country invited him.
Down there in Ille, in his swampy wood, game
was plentiful. When he was free from his office
he took his gun and was off. Then he came
home again happy, with a sunburnt face.</p>

<p>In the green room arms stood in the old cupboard
where Ulwing the builder used to keep
his plans. Above the couch the portrait of the
architects Fischer von Erlach and Mansard were
replaced by English prints of hunting scenes.
Cartridges were kept in the small recesses of
the writing table with the many drawers. A
finely wrought hunting knife lay in front of the
marble clock.</p>

<p>Anne sometimes felt that Thomas did not love
the old house or the green room or the cosy, well-padded
good old furniture.</p>

<p>“I say, Anne, these chairs here stand round
the table like fat middle-class women in the market.
They hold their arms akimbo and are
nearly bursting with health.”</p>

<p>He laughed quietly.</p>

<p>“Is it possible you cannot see how funny they
are? At home, in Ille, there is a similar armchair
in the nursery. We called it ‘Frau Mayer’
and put a basket on its arm.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>Anne blushed a little and, disconcerted, looked
at the chequered linen covers.</p>

<p>“They insult us,” she said, as if speaking to the
armchair, “though we belong together....”
She thought suddenly of the staircase in the
Geramb house, of Bertha Bajmoczy ... the
old indignity ... the old resentment. Then,
as if her grandfather’s voice echoed in her memory,
“I am a free citizen.”</p>

<p>She raised her head. Her young neck bent
back disdainfully.</p>

<p>“How beautiful you are, like this,” said
Thomas and his voice altered.</p>

<p>The woman’s shoulder trembled. That was
the old voice that thrilled her like a touch. They
looked at each other for a moment and then she
disappeared in Thomas’s embrace.</p>

<p>Anne felt that in her husband’s arms all her
cares vanished, that she herself passed away.
Her head fell back, no longer with pride but
with that feminine movement which expresses the
conquest of the conqueror.</p>

<p>“My love....”</p>

<p>They held each other for a long time tightly
embraced and the silence of rare and secret reunions
came over them. When the silence broke,
the reunion was ended and they both withdrew
into themselves.</p>

<p>Later in the day, Anne came running through
the rooms with a telegram and joy rang in her
voice:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span></p>

<p>“From Christopher!”</p>

<p>“Is he still in Baden-Baden?” sneered Thomas.</p>

<p>“He is coming to-night.”</p>

<p>“It is time....”</p>

<p>Anne cast her eyes down sadly. She always
felt some irritation in Thomas’s voice when he
spoke of Christopher and that pained her. It
was true that since their father’s death Christopher
had travelled a great deal, but Otto Füger
sent him regular reports and when he was home
he worked.</p>

<p>Business must have been excellent. There
was more luxury in the house than ever. Christopher
had replaced the old boards by parquet
flooring. Carpets were laid on the stairs and
two pairs of horses stood in the stable. A manservant
served at table in Netti’s place. Florian
opened the gate in livery. Anne received as
much money as she liked for housekeeping, that
was all she understood. But if Thomas was not
content, why did he keep silent? Surely it would
have been his duty to look through the business
books. Why did he shrink from it?</p>

<p>Anne believed that he despised the business
and, as in her mind the business and the name of
Ulwing were inseparable, she felt affronted
by her husband’s aloof indifference. In the beginning,
she had frequently raised the question
with Thomas. He always maintained a repelling
silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>She turned to him, but her husband, as if
divining her thoughts, anticipated her.</p>

<p>“Let us leave that alone, darling. I won’t
interfere with the affairs of the Ulwing business.”
He thought of what her father had told him when
he asked for his daughter’s hand. A man must
keep his word even if he has not given it formally.
He put his arms out and drew his wife onto his
knee.</p>

<p>“Let us stay together. I have to leave to-night,
I am going shooting to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Anne put her arms round Thomas’s neck.
However much she desired it, she would not ask
her husband in words not to go away from her.
But to-day she knew something that was sure
to retain him. She smiled into his face.</p>

<p>“Do you know what day to-morrow is?”</p>

<p>Thomas became cheerful.</p>

<p>“Of course, Sunday. I can go to shoot.”</p>

<p>“The third anniversary of our wedding,”
whispered Anne.</p>

<p>“Is that so? To-morrow?” Thomas’s eyes
became affectionate with grateful remembrance
and he pressed his wife passionately to his breast.
He felt her slender body bend from his knee into
his arms. Her small, cool face, nestled close to
his. Her hair smelt of violets. It made him
reel....</p>

<p>“He does not say he will stay at home,”
thought Anne, “he never says anything.” Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
soul felt degraded by the caresses bestowed on
her body. “Never anything but this.... I
don’t want it.” She pushed her husband
brusquely away and arranged her hair.</p>

<p>Thomas felt a cold void in his lap. For a moment
he looked disconcerted into the air, then
he collected himself. His love was a request
from a man, not the humble supplication of a
beggar. He frowned obstinately.</p>

<p>“When does your train start?” asked Anne,
exhausting herself in the effort to appear unaffected.</p>

<p>The woman’s voice appeared quite strange to
Illey. “She does not ask me to stay. She sends
me away from her,” and his countenance became
at once dark and hostile from the memory of
thwarted desire. He pulled out his watch. He
returned it to his pocket without looking at it.
He began to hurry. He made his guns ready.
The cartridge bag exhaled something left in it
by the woods. The straps cracked delicately,
just like out there, when they rubbed together
over one’s shoulders; and his thoughts were no
more in the room, but were wandering far afield
over boundless, free lands, under the shining sun.</p>

<p>Anne said no more and left the room.</p>

<p>In the evening, while putting her little son to
sleep, she thought of past anniversaries....
Since when had life changed so much between
her and Thomas? The change must have come
slowly, she had not noticed it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p>The child was asleep. Anne opened the door
of the sunshine room and, after a long time, unconsciously
sat down to the piano. She did
not play, she did not sing, just leaned her head
on it as if she were leaning it on somebody’s
shoulder.</p>

<p>When Christopher arrived he found his sister
there near the mute instrument.</p>

<p>Anne looked at her brother aghast. How he
had changed of late. Clothes of an English cut
hung on his body. His once lovely hair with the
silver shine had thinned round his deep blue-veined
temples. The light eyelashes appeared
heavy over his exhausted eyes.</p>

<p>“And Thomas, gone a-shooting?”</p>

<p>“Have you been ill?” asked Anne, sitting
down opposite to him in the dining room.</p>

<p>“What makes you think so? No, just a trifle.”
Christopher ate hastily, speaking all the time in
a snatchy way. “There is nothing the matter
with me, only my nerves are bad just now when
I shall stand most in need of them. I want to
achieve great things. I have learned many new
things. But they require nerve.”</p>

<p>He lit a cigar; the match moved queerly between
his fingers. “In the past life depended
on the muscles of man, so development of muscles
was the principal aim of education. Now we
have to rely for everything on nerves, and nobody
looks after them.” His mouth twitched
slightly to one side. “Tell me, Anne, do you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
feel sometimes as if strings quivered in your
neck high up to the brain?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t feel that,” said Anne, and stared
at him.</p>

<p>Christopher laughed, ill at ease.</p>

<p>“Nor do I feel it, I only heard it spoken of.
A friend of mine ... you know ... nerves.”</p>

<p>Anne pressed her folded hands convulsively,
but her face remained calm.</p>

<p>“Tell your friend that he is ill and that he
better attend to it at once.”</p>

<p>Christopher blew the smoke into the air.</p>

<p>“The old ones had more resistance than we.
Our generation received so many shocks when
young. Do you remember the shell striking the
house? And the fire ... those among us who
were weak were broken by it, those who were
strong became stronger. You became stronger.
You are lucky, Anne, and it is good to be near
you, you are so sure and cool.”</p>

<p>“Then do remain always near me, Christopher.”</p>

<p>“Yes. By the way, do you sometimes start
up in terror at night? You understand, one
can’t ask these things from a stranger ... and
do you never feel when you are alone, that somebody
is standing behind your back? He stands
near the wall and watches what you are doing.”</p>

<p>Anne looked horrified at her brother.</p>

<p>“But that is folly....”</p>

<p>“Stove-fairies and piano-mice,” said Christopher<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
and smiled wearily towards the green room.
“And little George?” He laughed with forced
mirth, “he must be quite a little gentleman. I
brought him a horse from Paris. It has an engine
inside, you wind it up like a clock and then
it runs. What wonders people invent nowadays!”</p>

<p>He began to speak of cities, countries ... of
the French Emperor, the Paris Stock Exchange,
the dresses of the Empress Eugénie. All the
time he smoked one cigar after another; after a
time weariness disappeared from his voice and
his eyes became livelier. When he went downstairs
he whistled. Anne heard it clearly but it
did not reassure her.</p>

<p>Since his sister’s marriage Christopher had
lived on the ground floor. He had adapted two
rooms of the old office which had been empty
since the business had dwindled.</p>

<p>Flowers stood on the chest of drawers in the
deep vaulted room. He knew Anne had put
them there. It was she who had put the lace
mat on the night table. For an instant he felt
happy at being home again and gave orders to
the servant not to wake him in the morning; he
wanted to sleep. Then he remembered that he
had business on the morrow with his book-keeper.
He had signed many bills in blank during his
journey, so that Otto Füger might send him
some money. He had lost incessantly at Baden-Baden
and his stay in Paris had made a serious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
breach in his purse. To-morrow all that would
have to be reckoned up. Hazy ignorance was
comfortable, but the reckoning day was loathsome.</p>

<p>He wanted to chase away unpleasant thoughts.
They were like wasps, returned to the attack, and
stung him.</p>

<p>And the business? How had the various enterprises
prospered while he had been away?
The weekly reports were in his valise. He had
never found time to read them through. It
didn’t matter. He had studied the Stock Exchange
in Paris. People got rich there in one
day. All that was required was a cool head.
One must not lose one’s nerve. How much
money he had seen! How much!</p>

<p>He extinguished the candle. He lay on his
back with open eyes. For a time his thoughts
gave him a rest. The darkness was quite empty.
How many things had passed through his darknesses!
Ancient fairies and dwarfs. Sophie,
his first love. Girls from the streets, actresses,
women, beautiful grand ladies, cold and indifferent
in day time, passionate and exacting at night.
Enough. They interested him no more. The
only thing that mattered to him now was money,
the mighty mass of money which flows incessantly
between the hands of men, like a great
dominating river, from one end of the world to
the other. One had only to dig a channel for the
river and it would flow wherever one liked. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
saw it on the Paris Stock Exchange. How
much money....</p>

<p>The darkness of Christopher’s night was suddenly
empty no more.</p>

<p>Money!... That was the whole secret....
And he began to long for it as he used
to yearn in days gone by for women.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The hanging lamp over the table in the
green room had been lit.</p>

<p>Anne’s hand fell slowly from the
child’s cap she was crocheting. She
had been aware for a long time of the irregular
sounds of Christopher’s steps. Her brother
walked restlessly up and down the rooms. Occasionally
he bumped into the open wings of
doors, then again he would make aimless, unnecessary
circuits round the furniture.</p>

<p>Anne noticed that Thomas dropped the newspaper
he was reading upon his knees. He too
was listening to the disordered steps.</p>

<p>Again Christopher came in collision with a
door, then he stopped nervously near the table.</p>

<p>“Land fetches a big price nowadays.” While
he spoke he lit a cigar and the smoke came in
puffs from his lips. “It will never again fetch
as much. We ought to sell some of the building
sites; we have too many; at any rate I know of a
better investment.”</p>

<p>Anne did not like the idea. She would have
liked to keep everything as it had been left to
them by their grandfather.</p>

<p>“Our grandfather would be the first to exploit
this exorbitant boom,” said Christopher with unnecessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
temper. “You don’t understand these
things, my dear.”</p>

<p>Anne sighed.</p>

<p>“You are right. Speak to Thomas about it.”</p>

<p>“To me?” Illey laughed frigidly. Looking at
Christopher his expression became haughty. “I
understand that you gamble on the Stock Exchange
and that you win. Take care. It is
always like that at the start and then fortune
turns. People only stop it when they have
broken their necks.”</p>

<p>“You have to remain cool, nothing else,”
growled Christopher, “one must not lose one’s
nerve. Anyhow, that has nothing to do with it.
What is your opinion about selling building
sites?”</p>

<p>Thomas shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“I have no opinion. I am unacquainted with
the circumstances.” He was aware that his obstinate
reticence was nothing but the expression
of his disappointed hopes. Yet he could not
alter it.</p>

<p>Christopher was delighted that everything
went so smoothly. As a matter of fact he had
already sold some of the sites. Now that the
deed was done, he was given the required consent.
He breathed more freely. He would sell
the old timber yard too. Otto Füger was a
clever go-between.</p>

<p>Anne took up her work again. Thomas’s
aloof indifference revolted her. She had lost her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
confidence in Christopher. She suspected Otto
Füger, but she did not understand business.
She had never been taught anything but to sing,
to embroider, to play the piano and to dance.</p>

<p>She decided that when her little girl was born,
she would make her learn everything that her
mother did not know. And while still young,
she should be taught that people can never be
entirely happy. She would tell it to her simply,
so that she could understand and not be obliged
later on to hug to herself something that nobody
wants and that is always unconsciously trampled
on by those to whom it is vainly proffered.</p>

<p>But the little girl, for whom Anne was waiting
in the old house, never came. In spring the
second boy was born and he was christened Ladislaus
Thomas John Christopher in the old
church, now rebuilt, at Leopold’s town.</p>

<p>After that Anne was ill for a long time. The
cold gleam, which had formerly made her glance
so hard, disappeared from her eye. The lines
of her fine eyebrows softened down. Her boyish
bony little hands became softer, more womanly.</p>

<p>Then she was about again, but the shadow of
her sufferings remained on her face.</p>

<p>Thomas was courteous and attentive. He
brought her books. For hours he read to her
aloud, without stopping, as if driven; he seemed
to fear Anne’s gaze which his eye had to face
when he put the book down. What did this
gaze want? Did it say anything, or ask, or beg,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
or command? No, Anne wanted nothing more
from him. The time was past when.... He
buried his face sadly in his hands.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Year by year Thomas became more taciturn
and if Anne asked him whether anything hurt
him or if he had any worries, he shook his head
impatiently. No, there was nothing the matter
with him; that was just his Hungarian nature.</p>

<p>But when he took his son on his knee he told
him tales of big forests, an ancestral country
house, an old garden. Fields, horses, harvests
in the glaring sun ... and his face became rejuvenated
and he held his head as of old, in the
little glen, when he turned towards the sun.</p>

<p>Anne had become accustomed not to be told
these things by her husband. Nor did she mention
Ille when letters in a female hand came
thence and one handwriting, with its shapeless,
rustic characters, repeated itself frequently.
When once it happened that Otto Füger brought
the mail up, Anne found one of these letters on
the piano. She took it into her hand and the
contact made her tremble. She had to struggle
against herself; was it pride, honesty, or cowardice?
She put the envelope untouched on
Thomas’s table. She did not question him, she
did not complain, but she never spoke of Ille
again.</p>

<p>From that time the name of this strange land
became a ghost in the house. They never pronounced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
it, but it was ever there between them.</p>

<p>It seemed to Anne that even now it was stealing,
hostile, through the silence, drawing Thomas
away from her. Desperate fear possessed her;
she felt that she was going to be left alone in icy
darkness with no way out of it.</p>

<p>“Thomas,” she said imploringly, as if calling
for help, “why can’t we talk to each other?”</p>

<p>Illey raised his head from between his hands.</p>

<p>“Are you reproaching me with my nature
again?”</p>

<p>Anne perceived impatient irritation in her
husband’s voice.</p>

<p>“I did not mean it like that”; the woman
stopped short as if a hand had been put rudely
before her mouth.</p>

<p>Night was pouring slowly into the sunshine
room. They could not see each other’s faces
when Thomas began suddenly to listen; he
seemed to hear suppressed sobs.... No, it was
imagination; his wife never cried. They had
been silent for such a long time that Anne had
merely fallen asleep in the corner of the couch.
Illey rose and closed the door noiselessly behind
him.</p>

<p>During Anne’s illness Thomas had moved
from the common bedroom into the back room
which had once belonged to Ulwing the builder.
When she improved, he did not himself know
why, he remained there. His wife did not oppose
it and he was fond of the room. From the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
window he could touch the leaves of the chestnut
tree and after rain the smell of the damp earth in
the garden reached him.</p>

<p>He sat on the window sill. Outside, the trees
whispered.</p>

<p>Thomas’s mind was gone from among the
closed walls. Desire carried his soul beyond the
town. He strolled alone and was met by a breeze
smelling of rain. How he loved that! How he
loved everything out of doors: the smells, the
colours, the sounds, the steaming bogs of boiling
summer, the frozen roads of winter, where one’s
footsteps ring and the branches crack as they
fall. Then the wind rises from the soughing
reeds and life trembles over the world. In the
furrows, the water soaks into the ground. The
wood resounds with the amorous complaint of
birds. Call ... answer. Do they always find
their mate?</p>

<p>In his heart Thomas nearly felt the silence of
the woods. The seed of reproduction falls in
this trembling, solemn peace. Birds float slowly
in the sunshine. When the hour of the crops
comes, summer is there. Harvest is in full
swing everywhere and his blood is haunted with
inherited memories. How often, how often, he
has stopped at the edge of somebody else’s wheat-field
and clenched his fist. Nowhere in the world
is anything growing for him.</p>

<p>This memory brought sad autumn weather to
his mind. A deep sad fall ... and he comes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
in a mist towards the town. He comes like an
escaped convict brought back to his prison.
Again the paved streets and narrow strips of
smoky sky. Office, blotches of ink, paper and
the old house, which is strange to him, and the
lovely cold woman who does not understand him.</p>

<p>Dim recollections stole upon him. Again he
seemed to feel Anne’s two little protesting hands
on his breast and that unsympathetic look which
had more than once repelled his desire.</p>

<p>He stretched his hand out of the window towards
the chestnut tree. He picked a young
shoot. The bough yielded itself easily, moist,
fresh....</p>

<p>He thought of someone who had yielded herself
as easily as the young shoot. She had been
bred there on his old land, the daughter of the
keeper in the swampy wood. Humble, as the
former serf-girls had been with his ancestors,
pretty too, with laughing eyes. She never asked
what her master was brooding about, and yet she
knew. The woods, the meadows, she too thought
of them and she sang of them with the very voice
of the earth. One did not need to listen, one
could whistle, she expected no praise. No more
do the birds....</p>

<p>Thomas could not remember how it was at first
that he desired the girl. He simply wanted her,
like the perfume of the woods, the soft meadows
under his feet. His inherited man-conscience did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
not reprove him. He did not think there was
any sin, any unfaithfulness in it, for he did not
love this girl. He really believed that he did not
wrong Anne or deprive her of anything to which
she attached any importance.</p>

<p>He leaned again out of the window. He
looked up to the sky. He would see it to-morrow
above the woods.... Then he reached for his
hat. A rare event with him, he longed to hear
some gipsy music. He wanted to be solitary,
somewhere where the fiddle played for him alone.</p>

<p>He hesitated before Anne’s door. Should he
go in? Perhaps she was still asleep....</p>

<p>His steps sounded in the sunshine room.
Anne jumped up. If Thomas were to open the
door she would throw herself into his arms ...
but the steps passed by.</p>

<p>She started to run after him, then stopped
wearily before the threshold. She would abase
herself uselessly. And as she stood there she remembered
something. A dream. A desolated
strange street. One solitary person at the furthest
end. Thomas ... and she runs after
him, but the distance does not become less. The
street becomes longer. Thomas seems always
further and further away and she cannot reach
him....</p>

<p>She thought of her girlhood, the time full of
promises. Was this to be their realization?
Would everything remain forever like this?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
Would she and Thomas never come together
again? Live with each other and look at each
other and remain strangers?</p>

<p>She shuddered as though she were cold.</p>

<p>Then she noticed that for a long time someone
had been ringing the front door bell. Who could
it be? The old friends came no more to her.
Thomas was taciturn with them too. They may
have thought it conceit and all stayed away. The
relations of the Illey family were avoided by
Anne. The voice of Bertha Bajmoczy stood between
her and the descendants of the old landlords.</p>

<p>A knock at the door. A lamp was burning
in the corridor and the shape of a man appeared
in the opening.</p>

<p>It was Adam Walter.</p>

<p>“After all this time....” And Anne thought
how wonderful it was that the old friend should
come back just this day when she felt her life
so poor and lonely. Joy came to her heart for
a moment. It seemed to her that her youth, her
girlhood, had returned to her, with everything
that distance embellished.</p>

<p>Adam Walter was grave and serious like a
man who has painful memories to bury in himself.
Yet his eyes followed Anne’s movements
eagerly while she reached to light the lamp. He
longed and feared to see her face again.</p>

<p>“She has suffered since I have seen her,”
thought Adam Walter, “and it has beautified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
her.” Anne’s veiled voice and her look broke
open in him a wound which he thought had long
ago healed. He too remembered his youth, when
he went away from her all unsuspecting, when
he worked, when he dreamed. Then he heard
that Anne had married and in the same instant
he realized that he loved her. He had loved
her always.</p>

<p>She seemed strangely tall and slender to him.
The flame flared up.</p>

<p>“To be here again with you ... it’s too good
to be true.”</p>

<p>“You ought not to speak like that.” Anne
smiled her old, young smile, “or do you still say
everything that passes through your mind? Do
you remember the Ferdinand Müllers? And
the new sign, the white head of Æsculapius?
How we laughed....”</p>

<p>“In those times everything was different,”
said Walter dryly.</p>

<p>Anne looked at him. “He too has become
old. How hard his looks are,” and the smile
that had rejuvenated her vanished from her face.</p>

<p>And Walter’s voice became ironical.</p>

<p>“And I thought I would create like God, just
like Him. Then my opera failed, nobody
wanted my sonatas. Nobody ... and now I
am humbly thankful to become assistant professor
in the National Academy of music.” He
laughed lifelessly. “But perhaps it was bound
to be like that. When a man in his youth wants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
to become like God, he becomes at least an assistant
professor in the end; who knows that if
he had started with the ambition of becoming an
assistant professor he would have ended by becoming
nothing at all.”</p>

<p>Anne looked sadly down. “So he too has
failed to grasp what he reached for. Does nobody
grasp it?”</p>

<p>“Once upon a time we were all revolutionaries,”
said Walter, “for is not youth a revolution
in itself? We are all borne to the executioner:
one for a thought, the other for a dream, and
... all of us for love. It sounds mad, but it
is so. Man must die many deaths in himself
to be able to live. I was just the same as the
others and those that are young to-day are as
we were in old times. In its unlimited conceit
youth of every age believes that it has discovered
the rising of the sun and all youth shouts vehemently
that its sun will never set. That is as
it ought to be. When the sun comes to set, the
youth of another age believes the same thing.
Men drop out, but their faith remains in others,
and in others again, and that is the thing that
matters.”</p>

<p>It seemed to Anne, that Adam Walter, who
once, when he was young, had guided her
thoughts to freedom, now taught her the art of
compromise.</p>

<p>Again Walter attempted to be ironical, but
his voice failed him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span></p>

<p>“Man is full of colours, brilliant colours, when
he starts. They all wear off. Only grey remains.
The awful grey spreads and becomes
greyer and greyer till it covers the man and his
life.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Walter, how sad all this is....”</p>

<p>“To me it is sad no more. I have got over
it. Don’t be sorry for me, please. Even for
the grey people there are still some lovely things
in this world. The grey ones see other people’s
colours. They alone can see them truly. Since
I have renounced creating myself, I enjoy peacefully,
profoundly, other people’s creations. Before,
I was aggressive and impatient, now I love
even Schumann and Schubert, and all those who
have dreamed and who woke from their dreams.”</p>

<p>Anne sat with half-closed eyes, bent a little,
and her pale hands were interlocked over her
knee.</p>

<p>“Have I grieved you?” asked Walter hesitatingly.</p>

<p>The woman shook her head.</p>

<p>“You have made me understand my own
life....”</p>

<p>“So she is no happier than I am,” thought
Walter, and for the moment he felt irrepressibly
reconciled to his fate. Then he was ashamed of
the feeling. He had no right to it. Anne was
not to blame for his state of mind. She knew
nothing of it.</p>

<p>“Do sing something....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span></p>

<p>She looked at him with large, beaming eyes.
It was a long time since anybody had said this
to her.</p>

<p>They began to talk of music. And this
changed them into their old selves; they were boy
and girl again, just as on Sundays in the old
days.</p>

<p>“Come again soon and bring your violin with
you,” said Anne when they took leave of each
other. Then it struck her that neither of them
had mentioned Thomas.</p>

<p>Adam Walter and Thomas Illey never became
friends. They met with courteous rigidity.
Adam Walter smiled disparagingly at Illey’s
views, while Illey’s mocking gaze tried to call
Anne’s attention to the musician’s ill-cut clothes
and shapeless heavy boots.</p>

<p>It mattered little to Anne. The piano stood
mute no more in the sunshine room and a bright
ray of light was cast on her life by the revival of
music, which indifference and want of appreciation
had silenced for so long. Its resurrection
was her salvation. Her soul ceased to be strangled
by the torture of enforced silence; it found
relief and took flight on the wings of songs, attended,
through many quiet evenings, by Walter’s
soul cast into the music of his violin.</p>

<p>Christopher looked in occasionally. He
patted his old school-mate on the back and
whistled softly to the music while he ran through
Stock Exchange reports in the papers. Soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
after his uneven steps passed again through the
corridor.</p>

<p>He could not find peace anywhere. Calculations
swarmed in his head. They appeared,
but before he was able to grasp them they scattered
and vanished. He had no idea if he was
winning or losing and he dared not look at his
accounts. Money became dearer and dearer.
Banks restricted their credit. Suspicious
rumours from Vienna reached the Stock Exchange
of Pest. Quotations fluctuated and declined
slowly, but he lacked the resolution to
wind up his transactions. He was still waiting,
still buying. He became intoxicated with the
fascination of risks and blind hopes. His nerves
were in a constant state of tremulous tension.
The lust for gain became the torturing passion
of his soul.</p>

<p>His grandfather had been the money’s conqueror,
his father its guardian and he, it seemed,
was to become its adventurer. No matter,
chance helped adventurers.</p>

<p>His nights became very long. Restlessly,
Christopher turned his head from one side to the
other on his hot pillow. He rose early. He was
no longer contented to send his agents on
’Change. He wanted to see the confusion, hear
the noise, feel the universal pulsation of money
as evinced in the excitement of the crowd.</p>

<p>He rushed through the office. Otto Füger
had become manager with full powers. He arranged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
the cover for speculations, he received
and paid out money in the name of the firm.
Christopher had no time to see to anything. In
unbusinesslike handwriting he put his name to
anything. Then he rushed away, leaving the
doors open behind him.</p>

<p>It was a lovely May morning.</p>

<p>At the Exchange in Dorothea Street brokers
stood on the stairs and transacted their business,
leaning against the balustrade. Men stood in
small groups in the acid, stuffy air of the cloak-room.
Subdued talk was heard here and there.
An old fat man with his hat perched on the back
of his head, passed wheat between his fingers
from one hand to the other. Near the window
a red-haired broker held some crushed maize in
the palm of his hand. He lifted it up, now and
then, and at intervals pushed his tongue out between
his yellow teeth. Scattered grain crackled
under people’s feet.</p>

<p>Doors banged in the big hall of the Stock Exchange.
The lesser fry was pushed back. There
was a crush round the bankers’ boxes. Slowly
the masters of the Exchange arrived. People
saluted them respectfully, as if they were paid
for it. The unimportant ones used to read their
faces, the gestures of their hands. The great
ones looked indifferent, though they were the men
who held the secrets which mean money. Nervous
heads swayed round a fat, owl-like face.
Those behind pressed eagerly forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span></p>

<p>Near Christopher a red-eyed, seedy-looking
man shrank to the wall. A worn out, long, silk
purse was in his hand. He began to suck the
ivory ring of the purse; people collided with him
and the ring knocked against his teeth; but he
went on sucking it.</p>

<p>“I sell....”</p>

<p>“I buy ...” cries came from all sides like
the shrieks of hawks.</p>

<p>Somebody’s hat fell on the floor ... it was
trampled under foot. A freckled hand waved
a bundle of papers.</p>

<p>“I sell ...” it came denser and denser. The
brokers of the big banks shouted themselves
hoarse. The noise increased. The stocks fell.</p>

<p>“Now ... now is the time to buy,” thought
Christopher in deadly excitement. His shrieks
joined the general pandemonium.</p>

<p>“People’s Bank, ninety-two....”</p>

<p>“Eighty ...” bellowed a brute voice.</p>

<p>“Seventy-six....”</p>

<p>Arms rose. Hands moved from their wrists,
flabby, like rags.</p>

<p>“Industrial Bank....”</p>

<p>“Credit Institute....”</p>

<p>“Forty-five ... forty-two.”</p>

<p>Faces were aflame. The gamble became a
wildfire, roasting people’s skins. Rumours
spread through the hall. Nobody knew whence
they came, they simply were suddenly there and
then scattered all over the place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>A deafening uproar followed. People blindly
believed anything. Prices fell. Somebody
bought. Blind confidence returned.</p>

<p>“I buy....”</p>

<p>Unconfirmed news of disaster came again.
The whole ’Change became a whirlpool, as if it
had been stirred round. Nobody knew what was
happening. Telegram forms flew over the place.
Fists beat wildly on the air.... Everything
was upside down.</p>

<p>A man with sweaty face flew like an arrow into
the crowd.</p>

<p>“There is a Black Saturday in Vienna! News
has just arrived. There is a slump all over
Europe.” Quotations fell head over heel.</p>

<p>A big broker tried to stem the tide. It swept
him away. It was all over.... In a few
seconds people, families, institutions, were ruined.
Lost were the easily-won fortunes of the day before,
never seen by those who owned them. Lost
were the old fortunes amassed by the hard work
of several generations....</p>

<p>Christopher leaned his snow-white face against
the wall. Near him, the seedy-looking man continued
mechanically to suck the ring of his purse.
He could not take his eyes off him. He stared
at him while he was ruined.</p>

<p>The brokers came panting. No, it was now
impossible to sell anything. What stood for
money an hour ago had become a valueless scrap
of paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span></p>

<p>The porter of the Stock Exchange rang the
bell. The death-knell.</p>

<p>Christopher could only mumble. Nobody
listened to him, his own agents left him there.
Only the weird man looked at him with funny,
bloodshot eyes.</p>

<p>Then strange faces passed quite near to his
face. A sickening smell of perspiration moved
with them in the air. Christopher’s eyes became
rigid and glassy. Faces ... faces of a strange
race. Some smiled pale smiles. These had won.
Everything would be theirs, it was only a question
of time. Theirs the gold, the town, the country.</p>

<p>And the grandson of Ulwing the builder,
ruined, tottered through the gates of the Stock
Exchange among the new men.</p>

<p>Life became confused and dreary. After
Black Saturday, the Stock Exchange differences
were enormous. No bright Sunday shone for
Christopher. He had to pay, and, as he had
never reckoned, he attacked Anne’s fortune too.
This was a secret between Otto Füger and himself.
He said nothing of it to Thomas.</p>

<p>He clutched like a drowning man. He
wanted to turn everything into money. To hide
the truth, to keep up appearances as long
as possible ... fighting, lying. Sometimes
Otto Füger whispered into his ears and then
he shrivelled up and looked horrified at the
door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>“No, no, tell them to-morrow.... It cannot
be done to-day!”</p>

<p>From day to day, from hour to hour, he kept
things going and the strings of his nerves tightened
in his neck. To gain time, if only minutes
... even a minute is a long time for a man
clinging to his life.</p>

<p>Summer passed like this and then, in autumn,
came the terrible wave of bankruptcy affecting
the whole building trade. The firm of Münster
became insolvent. Many of the new businesses
went bankrupt. Christopher alone kept himself
still going and one afternoon he carried his last
hope to Paternoster Street.</p>

<p>No one took any notice of him in the office.
One inferior clerk to whom he told his name
stared over his head. He had to wait a long
time before he entered the manager’s office.</p>

<p>The manager was reading a letter at his writing-table
and seemed to take no notice of his
presence. Christopher could not help remembering
how different everything had been when
he signed his first bill in this same office. The
smoky low room had disappeared and the business
occupied the whole building. It had become
a bank.</p>

<p>His eyes were arrested by the fat, owl-like
head of the all-powerful manager. He recognised
in him suddenly the little owl-faced clerk
who in those old times cringed humbly before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
him. The proportions of his face had doubled
since, and so had his body; there was scarcely
room enough for him in the armchair.</p>

<p>The director came to the letter’s end. He
lowered his head like a bull preparing to charge
and his dull eyes looked suspiciously over his
spectacles at Christopher.</p>

<p>“I have the pleasure of seeing Mr. Ulwing?
Yes ... of course, of course, I know the firm.
A connection dating from our youth.... Once
I happened to have the good fortune of meeting
a certain old Mr. Christopher Ulwing. Any relation
of yours? A powerful man, a distinguished
man.”</p>

<p>“My grandfather....”</p>

<p>The manager became at once very polite. He
offered Christopher a seat.</p>

<p>“Can I be of any service to you?”</p>

<p>Christopher was startled by this question,
though he had naturally expected it. He cast
his eyes down, pale, suffering. He would have
liked to defer the answer. Until it was given
there was still one last hope. After that none
might be left.</p>

<p>Owl-face moved the side-pieces of his gold-rimmed
spectacles which made an impression on
his fleshy temples.</p>

<p>“I am at your orders,” he said a little impatiently,
looking at the clock on the wall.</p>

<p>Christopher made an effort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>“I want a loan.”</p>

<p>The manager at once became cold and
haughty.</p>

<p>“Everybody wants one nowadays. Black
Saturday has ruined many people.”</p>

<p>“I don’t deny that it has caused some temporary
embarrassment to my firm too....”</p>

<p>“I know,” said the manager drily.</p>

<p>The whole face of Christopher was anxiously
convulsed.</p>

<p>“A short loan would help me considerably....”</p>

<p>“What security do you offer? The name
of Ulwing?” Owl-face smiled, “that I am afraid
is no longer enough....”</p>

<p>“My books are at your disposal, allow
me ...” stuttered Christopher. He felt clearly
that he was humiliating himself before a
stranger, though he knew but dared not confess
to himself that it was useless. He also knew
that it was hopeless to argue and still he
argued.</p>

<p>The manager looked coldly into his eyes.</p>

<p>“The Bank is carefully informed of everything.”</p>

<p>Christopher drew his head between his
shoulders as if expecting a blow. He twisted
his mouth helplessly to one side.</p>

<p>“You came too late to me, much too late,”
continued Owl-face. “Is it not a fact that the
house alone remains the property of the Ulwings?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
It is true it could not be sold at present.
Times are bad, but if I remember aright
the grounds are exceptionally large, well situated
in the middle of the town, and could bear a
heavy mortgage.”</p>

<p>Christopher hung his head in desperation.
The manager looked at him over his spectacles
expectantly. For an instant, kind, human pity
appeared in his eyes, then he sighed and dropped
his hand with a heavy movement on his knee.</p>

<p>“I can lend you money on the house. That
is the only way I can do it.”</p>

<p>With a motion of his hand, Christopher waved
the suggestion away. He was in the mire, but
he had strength enough to escape drowning in
it. He struggled no more with himself. He
felt he could never touch the house. At least
let that be preserved clear for Anne. The house,
the dear old house....</p>

<p>The banker rose when he had shaken hands
with Christopher and went with him to the door.</p>

<p>“I was a great admirer of Mr. Ulwing the
builder. I am sorry I cannot oblige his grandson.
Perhaps another time,” he added in a murmur,
as if he did not believe it himself.</p>

<p>Christopher smiled convulsively, painfully.
Even when he reached the street this smile remained
on his face and tortured his features.
He caught hold of the corner of his mouth and
pulled it downwards, sideways.</p>

<p>He did not know where he went. He ran<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
into people. An old gentleman shouted at him
angrily:</p>

<p>“Can’t you look out, young man?”</p>

<p>Christopher looked at him wearily. He
thought how this old man was younger than he,
because he would live longer than he.</p>

<p>When he reached home, he threw himself on
his bed. Curiously, he fell asleep at once. The
heavy dreams of exhaustion took possession of
him. Sweat ran from his brow.</p>

<p>When he woke, it was quite dark in the room.
At first he knew not where he was, nor what had
happened. Then, with a shock, he remembered.
He moaned like a suffering animal that cannot
tell its pains.... He could stand solitude no
more. Already he was on the threshold. On
the staircase he looked at his watch. Eleven
o’clock. He knocked timidly at the door of the
sunshine room.</p>

<p>“Anne, are you asleep?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a long time ago,” answered his sister inside.
The door opened. Anne tried to look
gay, but her eyes were sad.</p>

<p>“Do you remember, Christopher, how often
you asked that question in the old times from
your little railed bed?”</p>

<p>“And you answered then as you did now.
Then too I was afraid.”</p>

<p>Anne looked him straight in the eyes.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>Christopher laughed curiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span></p>

<p>“Can’t I make a joke when I am merry?
And what are you doing so late?” He looked
at the table. Under the shaded lamp lay account
books and bills.</p>

<p>“I have learnt about accounts,” said Anne
wearily, “so many bills have accumulated lately.
The tradesmen worry me and I receive no money
from the office. I cannot understand why Otto
Füger delays things like this.” She stopped
suddenly, thinking of something else. “Did
you hear?” and she began to run towards the
nursery.</p>

<p>Christopher dragged his steps behind her.</p>

<p>On the chest of drawers a night-lamp was
burning. In the deep recess of the earthenware
stove water was warming in a jug. Anne
leaned over one of the beds and her voice sounded
softly in the silence of the room:</p>

<p>“Here I am....”</p>

<p>Christopher’s heart was touched by these three
short words, which meant so much. He too had,
once upon a time, slept in the very same little
bed, he too had waked with a start, had been
afraid, but no mother’s voice came to say: “Here
I am.” He had never known a light cool hand
caressing for caresses’ sake, two warm womanly
arms embracing chastely, nor the clear smile that
has no design. He did not know her who understands
all and forgives all, and who says when
one is miserable: “Here I am!” Yet just that
might have been enough to alter his life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span></p>

<p>“They are lucky,” muttered Christopher as he
went back to the sunshine room. Anne, before
shutting the door behind her, put a piece of
paper between the two wings. She never forgot
that. The loose old doors had glass panes
and rattled if a carriage passed down below in
the street; this frightened little Ladislaus.</p>

<p>“This ought to be set right....”</p>

<p>Christopher sat in silence in the corner of the
sofa with the many flowers. He paid no attention.
Under his motionless eyelids he looked
wearily all round the room. He noticed suddenly
that Anne said nothing. Why did she not
speak? She would help him if she said something,
anything, words, ordinary matter-of-fact
everyday words, which had a sound, which lived
and caught hold of his mind, which held him back
if only for a minute at the brink of the abyss
which threatened him and filled him with horror.</p>

<p>“Anne, tell me a story.”</p>

<p>She looked up from the little drawer into
which she had locked her bills.</p>

<p>“Tell you a story? What are you thinking
about? How can I tell a story who am living
within four walls?” she smiled and put her hand
on her brother’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Well, little Chris, once upon a time there
was an old house: in that house lived a woman
who never could sleep her fill, because her two
sons waked her up early every morning....”</p>

<p>Christopher’s face twitched as he rose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span></p>

<p>“You are right, let us go to sleep....” He
bent down and kissed his sister’s hand. “Good
night, Anne, and....” He wanted to say
something more, but turned his head away with
an effort and left the room.</p>

<p>In the corridor he stopped near the loose stone
slab and tried it. It was still loose. The ticking
of the marble clock accompanied him once more
down the stairs.</p>

<p>In his deep, vaulted room a candle was burning,
but the small flame could not cope with the
big room and left cavelike dark corners. A big
white spot attracted Christopher’s eyes. While
he had been with Anne, the servant had made his
bed and his clothes for the morrow were lying
there ready on a chair. He could not bear this
sight. To-morrow.... He choked. In that
moment a delicate crackling reached his ear.
He turned towards it.</p>

<p>The fire was burning in the stove and shone
through the old tiles. Christopher went up to
it, leaned his hand on the stove and looked
through the ventilators. Small flames flickered
among the logs. He looked at them for some
time with extraordinary interest, then raised
himself with a sigh.</p>

<p>Life had deprived him of everything. Whenever
he inspected closely things he believed in,
he always found them to be delusions, just like
the stove fairies. He had been running after
delusions too when he had fallen. He had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
broken when he fell; it was useless to try to
stand up again; he could do it no more. Even
if he could, what good would it be? All the people
he had come in contact with had broken a
piece off his soul, taken it with them and cast
it away. Where was he to seek the scattered
pieces?... What was left to him was too little
for life. A little honour, very little. A little
pity for Anne ... nothing else.</p>

<p>His hand slid from the stove. Why warm it
now, it was no longer worth while....</p>

<p>He went to the writing-table. Then, as if
disgusted, he pushed the papers away from
himself. He turned back at the threshold. He
threw a packet of letters into the fire. He put
his watch and his empty purse on the table. No,
he had nothing else on him.</p>

<p>In the garden the autumnal leaves rustled
gently, as if somebody’s teeth chattered in the
dark. Christopher slunk with bent back out of
the gate ... only the two pillar-men looked
after him.</p>

<p>“Just like a thief.” Somehow, he could not
understand why, his grandfather’s funeral came
to his mind. The mayor, the city councillors,
the flags of the guilds. The priests sang and the
bells tolled.... He leaned back, then he went
on with his unsteady, heavy steps.</p>

<p>The night was dense. In the mist the city
looked like a reflection in grey, murky water.
The light of the gas lamps faded away into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
air, the walls of the houses faded, the people’s
faces faded. With a shudder Christopher
turned up the collar of his coat.</p>

<p>He reached the Danube. He sought his way
between the barrels and bags of the docks.
Then he sat down on the lowest step, put his
arms around his shins and leaned his forehead
on his knees. He only wanted to rest for an instant.
Just for a short time.</p>

<p>He opened his eyes. Why did he wait? All
that was worth waiting for had gone.</p>

<p>In the damp air, the Danube seemed to rise....
It approached him with a soft black movement.
He shrank back instinctively, as if to escape,
and his hands clung in horror to the stones.</p>

<p>Suddenly this passed away. The great river
became beautiful and calm. The lamps of the
shore dipped swaying stairs of fire into the deep.
The river ceased to be hostile to Christopher. It
whispered to him and, as if recognising him, it
called him, as it had called the Ulwings of old.</p>

<p>The tired soul of Christopher responded to
the appeal and his body followed his soul.</p>

<p>After that he never came back again.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Things and events in which Christopher
had had a hand passed slowly, painfully
into oblivion. Hope was exhausted and
the old house awaited no more the home-coming
of the last Ulwing.</p>

<p>Anne knew everything.... The huge fortune
of Ulwing the builder was shattered before
anybody had raised its gold to the sun. This
fortune had never shone and those still living
only realized its immensity when they saw its
ruins.</p>

<p>Thomas choked when he told Anne the truth.
He was horrified by the words he had to pronounce,
he feared he would break his wife’s
heart.</p>

<p>Anne listened to him silently with bowed head,
only her face became deadly pale and her eyes
turned dim like the eyes of one dangerously ill.</p>

<p>“For a long time I have feared this would
happen,” she whispered gently, and straightened
herself up with a great effort as if to face the
misfortune. She seemed suddenly taller than
usual. Her expression became clear and brave
and the fine lines of her chin strong and determined.</p>

<p>“Don’t spare me anything, Thomas. I want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
to know all.” After that she only said that
Christopher’s creditors were to be paid in full;
she would have no stain on the name of Ulwing.</p>

<p>During the period that followed, Anne bore
her ruin with the same dominating will power
that Ulwing the builder had shown in building
up his fortune. Thomas Illey discovered in
Anne something he had not known hitherto.
An incomprehensible strength exuded from her,
the tenacious strength of the woman, which can
be greater among ruins than when it is called
upon to build.</p>

<p>Nobody ever heard her complain of the loss
of her fortune, nor did anybody ever see her
weep. Only on the sides of her forehead a
silvery gleam began to appear in the warm,
shaded gold of her hair.</p>

<p>Thomas Illey was now forced to concern himself
with the Ulwing business. He asked for
leave from his official duties and in front of the
grated ground-floor window of the builder’s former
office he worked hard with his lawyer among
the muddled books. He arranged matters with
the creditors, and the firm of Ulwing, known by
three generations, ceased to exist.</p>

<p>The small tablet was removed from the office
door. The employés were paid off. Of the ancient
ones, only a few remained, old Gemming
and Mr. Feuerlein. The eyes of the clerk were
very red when he took leave of Anne. In the
corridor, he turned back several times; he stopped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
on the stairs; with knees knocking together he
went round the garden and took a white pebble
with him as a keepsake.</p>

<p>When they had gone, Otto Füger alone remained
in his place for the liquidation. Thomas
rang for him. He asked for explanations.
Vague excuses were the answer.</p>

<p>“He knows nothing about it,” thought Otto
Füger and waited impatiently for the hour when
he would be free.</p>

<p>Illey appeared always cool. He did not
grope, and never lost his head. He listened
quietly to the end and stuck his hands into his
pockets while Füger took leave with deep obeisances.</p>

<p>But he went unusually slowly up the stairs.
When he turned from the sordid details of the
dissipation of this huge fortune, he was driven
to frenzy by the thought that an infinitely small
portion of it would have saved him the torture
of his invincible longing for the lands of Ille
which had tarnished the years of his youth. He
was wrung by a bitterness that robbed him of
speech when he came to face Anne.</p>

<p>She looked at him.</p>

<p>“Are you tired, Thomas?”</p>

<p>Illey shook his head and pressed his open hand
for an instant to his chest, as if something
weighed on him in the left breast-pocket of his
coat.</p>

<p>Anne struggled silently with her thoughts.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
She was convinced that if Thomas had made up
his mind years ago to do the work he had done
now, Christopher might be alive, the firm might
be alive, and the fortune too.</p>

<p>They accused each other without exchanging
a word. Only when a long time had passed did
they notice, both of them, that their silence had
become cold and horrible and that they could not
alter it.</p>

<p>After a few days the lawyer stopped his visits.
Thomas locked up the business books and had
the shutters fixed in the old study of Ulwing the
builder. He seemed quite calm now, only his
face was thinner than usual. In the outer office
he stopped in front of Otto Füger and looked
motionlessly down on him.</p>

<p>The former book-keeper became embarrassed.</p>

<p>“Sad work,” he stuttered, while he took off his
spectacles and wiped them energetically, holding
them near to his eyes.</p>

<p>“Scoundrel,” said Thomas Illey with imperturbable
calm, “you did your stealing cleverly.”</p>

<p>Otto Füger stared at him confounded. He
was not prepared for this. His lips parted, he
wanted to protest.</p>

<p>Illey looked down on him from head to foot.
He exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Clear out!” and, as Füger did not move, he
gripped him by the shoulders and without apparent
effort, thrust him out of the door. The
spectacles had fallen to the ground; as if he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
would not touch them with his hand for fear of
pollution, Thomas pushed them with the tip of
his shoe to the threshold.</p>

<p>Otto Füger spoke excitedly under the porch:</p>

<p>“Defamation of character.... We shall
meet again. Then we shall see. I’ll have the
law on you....”</p>

<p>He never did. It was not in his interest to
make a scandal. He was a rich man now.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the old house life became quiet and economical.
The offices on the ground floor were
let to strangers. The lodgings of Mrs. Henrietta
and the stables were transformed into a
warehouse by a wine-merchant. He built up
the windows and doors towards the back garden
and made an entrance from the street. Horses
and carriages passed to strangers. Of the servants
only Florian and Netti remained, and old
Mamsell Tini, who wiped clandestine tears from
her long, rigid face.</p>

<p>Of late years the whole neighbourhood of the
house had changed. In place of the old timber
yard strange apartment houses had risen and
their grimy walls looked hideously and impertinently
into the garden. Between the Ulwing
house and the Danube a narrow street with four-storey
buildings. From her window Anne could
no longer see the lovely, wide river, the Castle
hill, the spires, the Jesuits’ Stairs up which she
once used to climb to Uncle Sebastian. Morning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
came later to the rooms than formerly. The
houses opposite sent their shadows into the windows.
The sun shone into them no more and
night fell earlier than of old.</p>

<p>Anne thought often that if her grandfather
were to come back he would feel strange in his
old town and would not find his way home.</p>

<p>The town grew rapidly and the years flew still
faster. Everything became faster than in the
old times. Anne remembered how, when she
was a child, time passed smoothly, calmly, while
now it rushed by as if it went downhill.</p>

<p>Thomas had a high and influential post in
his office. For a long time the two boys had
been going to school, and Anne, hearing their
lessons, learned more than she had known before.</p>

<p>In the garden the flowers began to bloom; the
holidays came; then it was again winter.</p>

<p>Christmas eve.</p>

<p>Not the former Christmas of childhood when
all was wonder, when the Christmas tree with
shining candles was brought from woods beyond
the earth by angels above the snow-covered
house tops. This was a Christmas suitable for
grown-up people, a sober Christmas.</p>

<p>The boys smiled at the old tales. They themselves
had decorated the tree the evening before.
After supper they both felt sleepy and gathered
their presents quietly together in the sunshine
room.</p>

<p>George had received a watch and books and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
a real gun from his father. His mother had
given building bricks to little Ladislaus.</p>

<p>“Hurry up. It is late,” said Thomas.</p>

<p>Sleep suddenly forsook the boys’ eyes. “Next
Christmas I shall ask for things to build a bridge
with,” decided the smaller boy with true childlike
insatiability.</p>

<p>George shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“If I were you I should ask for horses like
those we saw in the shop window the other day.
When I was little they did not make such lovely
toys as they do now.”</p>

<p>“You are for ever thinking of horses,” retorted
the little son. “I want to build bridges.
When I am grown up I shall build a bridge
over the Danube and get a lot of toll from everybody.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly,” said the elder, “as if one
could not get rich with horses!”</p>

<p>Thomas smiled and looked at his wife.</p>

<p>“They have got your grandfather’s fine blood
in them.”</p>

<p>Anne looked after the boys. The younger
was fair and blue-eyed like the Ulwings. His
bony little fist resembled his great-grandfather’s
powerful hand and when he got into a temper his
jaw went to one side and his eyes became cold.</p>

<p>“Yes, but their appearance and movements
are yours, the shape of their heads too,” said she,
and, a thing she had not done for a long time,
she stroked Thomas’s head where it curved in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
such a noble, fine line into his neck. She did it
out of gratitude, because she loved his blood in
her sons. Then her hand slid into her husband’s
shoulder and an inordinate longing came over
her to lean her forehead on it. But what would
Thomas think of it? After all these years?
Perhaps he would be astonished and misconstrue
it? She blushed faintly and recovered herself.
She remembered that whenever she was seeking
pure tenderness, Thomas gave her something
else. Men never understand women when they
ask them for something for their soul.</p>

<p>Anne stood a moment longer near her husband
and then, as if overflowing with feelings
she could not express, she moved irresistibly
towards the piano.</p>

<p>“You want to sing?” asked Thomas, out of
humour now. “Has not Adam Walter promised
to come? You will be able to have plenty
of music then.”</p>

<p>Anne stopped and looked at him over her
shoulder. The corners of her eyes and lips rose
slowly, sadly.</p>

<p>“Come and sit by me,” said Thomas, “let us
talk.”</p>

<p>“Talk....” The word repeated itself on
Anne’s lips like a lifeless echo. Was not this
word only a name, the name of something that
never came when called for?</p>

<p>They looked at each other enquiringly for a
little, then there was resigned silence. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
had been so many short words and long silences
between them, during which they were going
further and further apart, retreating into their
own souls instead of coming nearer to each other,
that they had to make a fresh start if they wanted
to talk to each other. A start from a painfully
long distance and ... this was Christmas eve.</p>

<p>“Do you hear?”</p>

<p>Anne shuddered and looked shiveringly
towards the dark rooms.</p>

<p>A delicate sound repeated itself obstinately,
like the sound of a tiny drill working in the depth
of things. It started over and over again. For
an instant it came from under the whitewash of
the ceiling, then up from the floor, from the windows,
from the beams, from everywhere.</p>

<p>“Do you hear?” asked Thomas and his hands
stopped in the air in the middle of the movement.</p>

<p>“I have heard it for a long time.” Anne’s lips
trembled while she tried to smile. They both
became silent again and the weevil continued its
work in the old house.</p>

<p>Thomas started when the steps of Adam
Walter resounded from the corridor. He went
to meet him and took the violin case out of his
hand.</p>

<p>“Welcome, dear troubadour,” then, as if he
had himself noticed his careless irony, he added:
“Do sit down, my dear professor,” and offered
cigars to his guest.</p>

<p>“But of course, you want to make music.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
My wife has already started, an hour ago, to
air the piano.” He laughed quietly, looking
mockingly at the end of Walter’s necktie which
pointed rigidly into the air beside his white collar.</p>

<p>“What is the news in town?”</p>

<p>“I only see musicians,” said Walter with good-natured
condescension, “and they are fighting at
present over the score of the artist Richard
Wagner’s Parsifal. They are coming to blows.”</p>

<p>“Do tell me, professor, do you really take
those things seriously? Do you consider Art
something quite serious?”</p>

<p>Adam Walter wrinkled his low brow. He
smiled with mocking forbearance.</p>

<p>Anne looked at him as if making a request
that he should not continue the subject. It was
always painful to her when her husband talked
of these things. She found him on these occasions
hopelessly inconsequent, obstinately perverse.
She did not like to see him like that.</p>

<p>“I know you are angry if I say so,” Thomas
continued lightheartedly, “but my Hungarian
breed can see nothing in Art but an explanatory
imitation of Nature. We have no need of artists
to stand between us and living nature.
Any shepherd or cowherd can see the sunset of
the great plain without the need of having its
beauty worked into verses.”</p>

<p>Walter turned away as if he tried to escape
Anne’s irresistible imploring look. He wanted
to answer, for he felt he ought to answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span></p>

<p>“I understand music only. I can speak of
that alone. That is not an explanatory imitation
of nature, it is man’s only artistic achievement
which lives in him, and comes out of his
very own self.”</p>

<p>“I think so too,” said Anne gently. “Every
art represents what exists, music alone creates
what has never existed.”</p>

<p>“How they agree,” thought Thomas, vexed.
Then, rather disdainfully:</p>

<p>“Do not the musicians learn from the reeds,
the thunder, the wind, the birds?”</p>

<p>“Nature only knows harmony and discord,”
answered Adam Walter, “melody has been created
by man. Nature knows no melody.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say so, professor; have you never
walked in the woods? Have you never slept on
the moss near a brook?”</p>

<p>Adam Walter shook his head.</p>

<p>“I am afraid we don’t understand each other.”</p>

<p>“It seems impossible,” said Illey. “You are
one of those who like the painted landscape more
than the real, live country. I don’t want to smell
the violet in the scent bottle, but at the edge of
the woods.”</p>

<p>Walter looked suddenly at Anne and then, as
if comparing her with Thomas.</p>

<p>“Mr. Illey, you seem to me like the music of
the Tsigans.”</p>

<p>“Tsigan music,” repeated Anne thoughtfully,
“and I, what am I?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span></p>

<p>“You are a song by Schubert,” answered the
musician.</p>

<p>“The two don’t fit well together.... Do
light a cigar, professor. But, of course, you
want to make music.”</p>

<p>But that day Adam Walter did not draw his
violin from its case. A small nosegay was in it.
It was meant for Anne, but it remained there too.
He took it away with him, out into the snow,
back into the white Christmas night.</p>

<p>When he came again he brought a larger
bunch of flowers. It was a poor, ungainly bunch
wrapped up in a newspaper. He put it awkwardly
on the piano near Anne, and became
more and more embarrassed.</p>

<p>“Please don’t thank me, it is not worth it. I
thought of it quite by chance.”</p>

<p>Something flashed into Anne’s face which resembled
pain. She did not hear Walter’s voice
any more, she knew no more that he had brought
her flowers; all she remembered was that Thomas
never, never gave her flowers.</p>

<p>“Why? ...” and her hands raised doubtful,
dreamy chords from the piano. Her tender,
meek face became unconsciously tragical. She
began to sing.... A deep question sang
through her voice. The whole life of a woman
sobbed in it, complained, implored. It rent the
heart, it clamoured for the unattainable, the
promises of past youth, the dream, the realization.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span></p>

<p>Adam Walter became obsessed by the rapt
womanly voice. He went to the door, shut it
carelessly, then leaned immobile against the wall....
He stood there spellbound, even after the
last sound had died away. He was not in time
to harden his features into calmness, and Anne
understood his expression, because she was suffering
herself at the time. She received with a
grateful smile the tenderness which came to
her.... They remained like that for an instant.
Anne was the first to awake. And as if
she wanted to wake him, she looked towards the
door.</p>

<p>“I closed it,” said Walter humbly, “in order
that your voice should be nobody’s but
mine....”</p>

<p>Then he left and she gazed for a long time
into the growing darkness. Her tenderness,
which she had thought long extinct, was now
ablaze.</p>

<p>Thomas came in. Anne remembered that her
husband was going to shoot and knew he came
to take leave.</p>

<p>“Has the troubadour gone?” Illey looked
round the room. Suddenly he saw the flowers
on the piano. “Now he has started to bring you
flowers?”</p>

<p>Anne looked at him.</p>

<p>“Do you know, Thomas, it has struck me that
you never give me any flowers.”</p>

<p>“You don’t think I am going to give you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
flowers grown on somebody else’s land?” Illey
laughed harshly and left the room without a kiss,
without a word of farewell.</p>

<p>They had never yet parted like this. Anne
looked after him amazed.</p>

<p>“Have a good time!” she shouted and did not
recognize her own voice. It could be cold and
indifferent.</p>

<p>When Thomas descended the stairs, the sound
of Anne’s piano reached him. A sad song
echoed through the house.... He slammed the
street door furiously, as if he sought to slay the
music. He looked up from the cab. He suddenly
remembered that Anne once used to look
after him from the window. Once ... a long
time ago....</p>

<p>“She is probably pleased now when I go and
she can live for her music. That is what draws
her and Adam Walter together.” He rejected
roundly the image of Walter. He did
not want to think of him and Anne at the same
time, yet the two images would get mixed
up in his brain and he felt as if he had been
robbed.</p>

<p>The sound of the cab had passed. In the twilight
of the sunshine room the music had broken
off. Anne began to nurse the burning bitterness
with which she thought of her husband.
Could he not see that she suffered, that her
smiles, her calm, her indifference were all his?
Did he not know her face was all a mummery?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
A mask ... fearfully she raised her hand to
her face as though she would snatch something
from it....</p>

<p>At that moment a dawning light glimmered
in the depths of her mind, mounting up through
innumerable memories. An old, once meaningless
tale worked its way out slowly from oblivion.
First she only saw the setting: the small clockmaker’s
shop, her grandfather in front of a large,
semi-circular window, the old hand of Uncle Sebastian,
the violet-coloured tail coat, the buckled
shoes. She heard his voice again. Broken, unconnected
words came to her mind, reached
her heart ... and then, suddenly, there was
light.</p>

<p>“No, people don’t know what their neighbour’s
real face is like.... Everybody wears a mask,
nobody has the courage to take it off, nobody
dares to be the first because he cannot know
whether the others will follow his example, or
stone him.”</p>

<p>Anne’s thoughts repeated in despair the words
of the old story: “Everybody wears a mask,
everybody....” And perhaps the proud alone
were the charitable, for they wore the mask of
silence.</p>

<p>“Thomas,” she uttered his name aloud, as of
old, when their love began. It seemed to her
that she had found a torch which, on the dark
road, lit up her husband’s real face. She began
to expect him, though she knew he could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
come back so soon. She waited for him through
many long hours. Next day too she waited.</p>

<p>Evening came. Adam Walter arrived and
again brought some flowers in his violin-case.</p>

<p>Anne became absent-minded and restless.
The flowers only brought Thomas to her mind.
Adam Walter’s voice seemed strange to her and
his ardent glances irritated her. To-day not
even music could bring them together.</p>

<p>While reading the music, Anne listened continually
for sounds below. A cab stopped at
the door. Steps in the corridor. She rose involuntarily
and stretched her arms out as if she
wanted to stop someone who passed by....
The noise ceased outside and her arms felt weary.</p>

<p>Adam Walter watched her attentively and at
the same time peered relentlessly into his own
mind. He too felt now what so many others
had suffered; he thought with physical pain of
the other who was expected and passed by....
An expression of despair passed over his face.
Then, as if sneering at himself, he raised his low
brows and put his violin aside.</p>

<p>She started and looked at him enquiringly.</p>

<p>“I can’t to-day.” Walter’s voice attempted
to be harsh and repellent, but his eyes were hopelessly
sad.</p>

<p>Anne did not detain him when he started to
go. She felt relieved; now there was no more
need to control her expression, her movements.
She ran towards her husband’s room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span></p>

<p>Thomas stood with his back to the door in the
middle of the room.</p>

<p>“So you no longer even come to see me?” she
asked, and there was warmth in her voice.</p>

<p>“I knew you had company. I wanted to be
alone.”</p>

<p>Anne stepped back but she did not leave the
room as she would have done at any other time.
Thomas started walking up and down. Several
times he touched his left breast pocket and
pressed his open hand against his chest. He
stopped suddenly before Anne.</p>

<p>“I thank you for staying,” he said excitedly.
“I must speak to you.”</p>

<p>Anne looked at him frightened. “Has anything
happened to you?”</p>

<p>“No, nothing. Listen.... Ille is for sale.”</p>

<p>Thomas sat down on the window sill as if he
were tired. He related how he was shooting
over the swampy wood. One of the beaters told
him that the property of Ille was again up for
auction. Those to whom it belonged were ruined
and had left the place. He could not resist and
he walked all over the property, a thing he had
never done before. An old farm hand recognized
him. He called him young master as in
old times, though his hair was turning grey.
The bailiff recognized him too. And he saw the
big garden, the roof of the house, the free Danube,
the barn, the tree with the swing, whose
bark still showed the marks of the ropes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span></p>

<p>“You understand, Anne, all this is for sale,
cheap, it could be ours. And there my life
would have a purpose. You know, for the sake
of the boys.... A family survives only if it is
rooted in the soil. It is hopeless for a tree to
cast its seeds on the pavements of cities; lasting
life is impossible there. The families of city
folk are like their houses and last but three generations.
Country people are like the earth.
The earth outlives a house.... If only I could
go home, everything would be different.”</p>

<p>Astonishment disappeared from Anne’s face
and an indescribable terror appeared in its stead.</p>

<p>“And the house! We shall have to leave
here!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be frightened,” said Thomas icily. “I
do not want you to leave the house for my sake.
I never asked you for a sacrifice. Nor will I
now. But I can’t stand this any longer.”</p>

<p>Every word wounded Anne.</p>

<p>“Why do you hurt me like this?”</p>

<p>“So you would come with me?” He looked
at her incredulously, inquiringly. “Is it possible?
You would come with me, to me, now
when I have grown old and your love for me has
passed away?”</p>

<p>Anne smiled sadly.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think, Thomas, that the memories
of the road we have trodden together are as
strong a tie as love?”</p>

<p>He again drew his hand over his left breast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
pocket and then let it slip quickly to his waist as
if it had been done accidentally.</p>

<p>This movement caused Anne some anxiety.
She remembered that it had become frequent
lately. She thought no more of her troubles.</p>

<p>“What is the matter with you? What has
happened?” She turned back the frilly silk
shade of the lamp with a rapid movement.</p>

<p>They looked at each other as if they had not
met for a very long time.... When did their
ways part? When, for what word, for what
silence? Neither of them remembered. It must
have been long ago and since then they had
walked through life side by side, without each
other.</p>

<p>Anne leaned over Thomas. It seemed to her
that they had met at last on the dark road and
that she saw, through Uncle Sebastian’s story,
into the face she had never understood.</p>

<p>“You have suffered too, Thomas....” And
as if he were her child she took his head tenderly
between her hands. She pressed it to her bosom
and gently stroked his grey-sprinkled hair, his
wrinkles. She wanted to ask forgiveness of
Thomas for the marks left by their sad misunderstandings.
Every touch of her hand demolished
one of the barriers that had stood between them
and had obstructed their vision.</p>

<p>“I have not been kind to you,” he said sadly,
“I passed from your side because I thought of
nothing but of my craving for my land.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span></p>

<p>“And I thought something quite different,”
answered Anne, in a whisper. “You said nothing
and I am not one of those who can question.
We both kept silent and that was our misfortune.
I see now that silence can only cover
things, but cannot efface them. Dear God, why
did you not tell me your heart’s desire? Why
did you not speak while we were still rich?”</p>

<p>Thomas took his wife’s hand and kissed it.</p>

<p>“I was afraid you would not understand.
You understand me now&mdash;and it is not too late.”</p>

<p>“But how could we buy Ille?” she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“Do you remember that swampy wood?
Once nobody wanted it, now I am offered a good
price for it. That would go some way and I
might take the present mortgage over.”</p>

<p>Anne’s eyes opened wide with fear. She
thought of Christopher who had been swallowed
up by financial obligations.</p>

<p>“I shall work,” said Thomas and his voice became
quite youthful, “and pay off the debts.”</p>

<p>“Debts,” repeated Anne mechanically and the
practical blood of Ulwing the builder rose in her.</p>

<p>“No, Thomas, we don’t build on debts!” She
said this with such force as she had never before
put into her speech with her husband.</p>

<p>Thomas stared at her darkly for an instant.
Then his figure bent up in a curious way and
while he turned aside he made a gesture as if casting
something away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span></p>

<p>This gesture went to Anne’s heart. In her
despair, she must make another effort, fight a
last fight at the cost of any sacrifice. And while
her bewildered mind was seeking for a solution,
her eye followed her husband’s glance instinctively,
through the window, to the garden where,
under the evening sky the steep roof descended
near the gargoyle.</p>

<p>Both looked at it silently. The two wills were
fighting no more against each other and Anne
felt with relief that they thought in unison. She
buried her face in her hands convulsively, as if
pressing a mask on it, a mask heavier than the
old one, one she would have to bear now, for ever,
for the rest of her life. Then she looked up.</p>

<p>“We must sell the house.”</p>

<p>In that moment, within the ancient walls, a
cord, strained for a long time, suddenly snapped
in great, invisible pain.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Strange steps walked through the
house, indifferent, careless steps. They
passed along the corridor and went up
even to the attics. Down in the courtyard
bleak business voices bargained and depreciated
everything. They said that the ground
alone had any value that could be discussed. As
for the building, it did not count&mdash;a useless old
chattel, no longer conforming to modern requirements.</p>

<p>Anne looked round as if fearing that the house
might hear this. She felt tempted to shout to
the agents to clear out of the place and never
dare to come back again. Let old Florian lock
the gate. Let the days be again as secure as of
old, when there was no fear that they must break
off their lives in the old house and have to continue
elsewhere.</p>

<p>In the green room an agent knocked at the
wall and laughed.</p>

<p>“Strong as a fortress. The pickaxe will have
hard work with these old bricks.”</p>

<p>Anne could listen no more. She moved herself
to the furthest room and hid so that Thomas
might not look into her eyes. Why destroy her
husband’s bliss? He was so contented and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
grateful. He worked, planned, discussed, bargained.
At the auction Ille had fallen to him
and his eyes glistened marvellously when he
spoke of it. “Soon our house at home will be
ready, and the farm too. Everything in its old
place, the furniture, the pictures, the servants,
the bailiff, the agent, even the old housekeeper.
The crops are promising.... Are you pleased,
Anne? You rejoice with me, don’t you? The
earth will produce for us.”</p>

<p>Feverishly, disorderly haste spoke in his voice,
in his actions. Anne was tired and slow; it took
her a long time to go from one room to another;
there was so much to be looked at on her
way....</p>

<p>Thomas prepared for re-union and counted
the days impatiently; Anne took leave and woke
every morning with fear.</p>

<p>“Nothing has happened yet.” She looked
round, and, being alone, she repeated it aloud
so that the walls might hear it.... Then again
she was frightened. “Perhaps to-day ... to-night....”</p>

<p>Then the day came.</p>

<p>A stranger walked with Thomas in the back
garden. He trod on the flower beds and turned
his head several times towards the house. Anne
saw his owl-like face from the staircase window,
watched his movements anxiously. He too bargained
and depreciated everything. She began
to hope: perhaps he would go away like the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
others, life would remain in its old groove and the
day which was to be the last day of all would
never come.</p>

<p>The owl-like face began to ascend under the
vaults of the staircase and smiled. It looked
into the sunshine room. Vainly Anne fled from
it; she met it again in the green room.</p>

<p>The stranger, feeling quite at home, leaned
now against the writing table with the many
drawers and said something to Thomas.</p>

<p>Anne did not understand clearly what was
said, but she felt as if a sharp, short blow had
struck her brow. Her brain was stunned by it.
Thomas’s voice too reached her ear confusedly,
but she saw with despairing certitude that his
countenance brightened.</p>

<p>When an hour later the banker from Paternoster
Street left, the old house was already his.</p>

<p>For days the dull pain behind Anne’s brow
did not cease. Everything that happened
around her seemed unreal: the sudden departure
of the people from the ground floor, the packing
up of everything all over the house.</p>

<p>The time for delivery was short. The greatest
haste was necessary.</p>

<p>The old pieces of furniture moved from their
places, as clumsily, painfully, as old people move
from their accustomed corners. Below, in front
of the house, rattling furniture vans stopped
now and then.</p>

<p>Anne looked out of the window. Barefooted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
sweating men carried the piano out of the door.
The pampered household gods stood piled up
in a heap in the middle of the pavement, amidst
the crowd of the street. A man sat on the music
chest. Christopher’s old desk lay upside down
on top of the chest of drawers, just like a dead
animal, its four legs up in the air.</p>

<p>In these days, Thomas travelled repeatedly
from home, for he wanted himself to supervise
the placing of the furniture of the old house in
the manor house of Ille.</p>

<p>The boys were made noisy by their expectation
of new and unknown things. They spoke
of Ille as if it were the realization of a fairy tale&mdash;a
fairy tale told by their father.</p>

<p>“They don’t cling to the old house,” thought
Anne and felt lonely. She liked best to be by
herself. Then her imagination restored everything
to its old place in the dismantled rooms.
The shapes of the furniture were visible on the
wall papers. The forsaken nails stretched out
of the walls like fingers asking for something.
In the place of Mrs. Christina’s portrait a weary
shadow looked like a faded memory.</p>

<p>Another piece of furniture disappeared, then
another.... The writing-table with many
drawers remained alone in the green room.
Anne drew the drawers out one by one. One
contained some embroideries made in cross-stitch.
How ugly and sweet they were! She remembered
them well, she had made them for her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
grandfather. Then some clumsy old drawings
came into her hands, quaint castles, girls, big-eared
cats; two silvery, fair curls, in a paper,
tied together; beneath them an old distant date
in her grandfather’s faded writing.</p>

<p>Whenever the clock struck she started and
touched her forehead as if it had struck her to
hurry her on.</p>

<p>In another drawer she found a diploma of
the Freedom of the Royal Free City of Pest and
a worn little book. On its cover a two-headed
eagle held the arms of Hungary between its
claws.</p>

<p>... Pozsony. A. D. 1797, Christopher Ulwing
... civil carpenter....</p>

<p>While she turned the pages a faint, mouldy
odour fanned her face. Her memory searched
hesitatingly:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Two prentice lads once wandered</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To strange lands far away.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Suddenly the torpor of her brain was dispelled.
Reality assumed its merciless shape in
her conscience. She had to leave here, everything
would be different.... Unchecked tears
flowed down her cheeks.</p>

<p>She had no courage to pack the contents of
the drawers, nor the heart to have the open
boxes nailed down. Anything that seemed final
filled her with horror.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span></p>

<p>Somewhere a door creaked. Anne woke to
her helplessness. She pretended to hurry and
strained her efforts to hide her feelings before
those she loved.</p>

<p>The boys were preparing for their examinations.
Thomas noticed nothing. In the egotism
of his own happiness he passed blindly beside
Anne’s shy, wordless pain. He was pleased
with everything, only his wife’s apathy irked
him.</p>

<p>A half-opened drawer, an empty cupboard,
could stop Anne for hours. In her poor tortured
brain memories alone had room. Everything
spoke of the past. Even in the attics
she only met with memories.</p>

<p>Uncle Sebastian’s shaky winged armchair;
the grimy engravings of Fischer von Erlach and
Mansard; the out of date coloured map of Pest-Buda....
She took the map to the light of the
attic window. For a long time she contemplated
the lines of the short crooked streets, the Danube
painted blue, the small vessels of the boat-bridge,
the small churches, the many empty building
plots.</p>

<p>She could not find her way on the map. Over
her childhood’s memories a new big city had
risen, had swallowed in its growth the old streets,
removed the markets, spread beyond the limits
of the tattered map, spread even beyond the cold,
confident dreams of Ulwing the builder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span></p>

<p>Wearily Anne went down the stairs and evening
found her again immobile in front of an open
cupboard. She sat on the ground and on her
knee lay an old shrunken cigar case, embroidered
with beads....</p>

<p>Steps approached from the adjoining room.
She became attentive and really wanted to be
quick, but forgot that she was engaged in filling
an empty box and with rapid movements she instinctively
returned everything to its usual place
in the cupboard.</p>

<p>Thomas stopped near her.</p>

<p>“What do you think, how much more time do
you require?”</p>

<p>“There is still much to be done,” answered
Anne guardedly. What it was she could not
have told.</p>

<p>“In a week the house has to be handed over,”
muttered her husband nervously.</p>

<p>Anne looked up at him.</p>

<p>The lamplight lit up Thomas’s face. How
old and worn out he looked! His well-shaped
mouth seemed pitifully dry and between his
cheek bones the sunken crevices were darkened
with purplish-blue shadows.</p>

<p>Anne thought her eyes deluded her and got
up.</p>

<p>Thomas snatched at his chest and again made
the ominous movement with his hand. Anne
could no longer believe that it was accidental.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
As if to escape her maddening anxiety she flung
herself into his arms and pressed her head to his
chest.</p>

<p>Thomas stood motionless as if he had lost
consciousness. He breathed heavily and stared
anxiously into space above his wife’s head. His
heart beat faintly a rapid course, stumbled suddenly,
and for an instant there was an awful,
cold silence in his chest.</p>

<p>Anne listened with bated breath. Under her
head, the rapid irregular gallop started again.</p>

<p>As if he had only then noticed his wife’s proximity,
Thomas stretched himself out and pushed
her away impatiently. Anne remembered that
this was not the first time this had happened.
The awful truth dawned on her.</p>

<p>“It is nothing,” he said and made an effort to
laugh, but his laughter died away under Anne’s
pitiful look.</p>

<p>“Thomas, since when?”</p>

<p>“A long time ago.”</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, why did you not tell me?”</p>

<p>“I thought it would pass away at Ille....
Open the window. It is rather worse to-day....”
His face became ashen-grey, his
eyes appealed for help. With a single gesture
he tore his shirt-collar open.</p>

<p>Anne flew through the room.</p>

<p>“Call the doctor! The doctor....”</p>

<p>It sounded all through the house when Florian
slammed the street door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span></p>

<p>Hours came and passed and left their marks
on the faces of the people in the old house.
Thomas was already in bed. On the vaulted
staircase Anne talked for a long time with Dr.
Gárdos, the son of the old proto-medicus.</p>

<p>The doctor’s voice was strangled; his words
scarcely reached Anne and yet they annihilated
everything around her. Had she not yet lost
enough? Was there no mercy for her?</p>

<p>Dr. Gárdos looked at her full of pity.</p>

<p>“Miracles might happen....”</p>

<p>The corners of Anne’s eyes drew up slowly
and horror was in her expression. She shivered
and then went back through the corridor with
strained, stiff lips. When Thomas as in a
dream reached for her hand, she bent over him
with her wan, crushed smile.</p>

<p>Dawn was slow to come and it was a long
time before evening fell again. Nothing altered
in the house, only the day opened and closed
its eyes.</p>

<p>Thomas lay motionless in his bed. Anne
watched his every breath anxiously, thought of
the passing hours and of the day that drew
threateningly nearer, on which the house was to
be surrendered.</p>

<p>She asked for delay. It was refused. She
had to accept the advice of young Doctor Gárdos.</p>

<p>The empty little lodgings in the house opposite
... there was no choice, they must move
there. They would have to rough it, there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
would be room enough for a few days. For the
doctor had told her, quite calmly, that it was only
a matter of a few days.</p>

<p>“So there are still miracles,” thought Anne.
“Yes, it is only for a short time and then ...
everything will come right again.” She felt relieved
and thus the last day in the old house
passed away.</p>

<p>It was evening. The two boys had already
gone with Tini into the lodgings opposite.
Thomas slept. Anne and the old servant sat up
with him; they did not dare to look at each other.</p>

<p>The windows were open; in the corridor, near
the wall, the marble clock ticked, on the floor.
The last thing left in the old house. Florian
insisted on carrying it over himself into the new
lodgings.</p>

<p>Anne counted the strokes of the clock. “In
three hours ... in two hours....” She rose
quietly, slid along the corridor, down the stairs.
In the back garden, between the high, ugly walls,
the old chestnut tree, the winged pump, the
bushes were all still in their places ... and one
could rest on the circular seat of the apple tree.
Everything was as of old, even the ticking of
the old clock came down into the garden.</p>

<p>Anne leaned her head against the trunk of the
tree; without taking her eyes off Thomas’s window,
she took leave of all things around her.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as if somebody’s speech had broken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
off in the act of saying farewell, the silence became
absolute. The clock had stopped.</p>

<p>Anne ran up the stairs. Now she remembered.
Last night she had forgotten the clock
and now the butterfly pendulum, which she had
seen alive, lay dead between the marble pillars.
She passed her hand wearily over her brow. So
the little dwarf had gone too! Had Time itself
forsaken the old house?</p>

<p>She opened the door of the green room. The
candle light floated round her up and down.
Her steps echoed sharply from the empty walls.
She stopped in front of the tall white doors with
the glass panes. On the panel rising notches
were visible. When they were children, Christopher
and she, their father had marked their
growth every year. She went further, trying
the door-handles carefully. Some were meek
and obedient, others creaked and resisted. She
knew them ... they had had their say in her
life. She knew the voice of everything in the
house. The windows spoke to her when they
were opened; the board of the threshold too had
something to say beneath her tread, always the
same thing, ever since she could remember. But
that was part of its destiny.</p>

<p>She slipped along the walls. She passed her
hand over the faded wallpaper, over the grey
stove, even over the window sills. She put the
candle down and looked through the small panes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
of glass towards the Danube, just like old times.
But the fronts of the houses opposite repelled
her looks.</p>

<p>A carriage rattled through the street: it
sounded like the crack of a whip. Anne clung
close to the walls and under the harmonizing influence
of the quiet night, the intimate physical
contact brought something suddenly home to her
that had lived in her unconscious self dimly unexpressed,
for the whole of her existence. In
that moment she understood the bond that existed
between her and the doomed old house.
The bricks under the whitewash, the beams, the
arches, all were creations of one single force and
she felt herself one with them as if she had grown
from between the walls, as if she were just a
chip of them, a chip privileged to move and say
aloud what they had to suffer in silence.</p>

<p>She thought of the finished lives, continued
in her who had survived everybody. Mysterious
memories of events she had never witnessed invaded
her mind. Grafts from memories treasured
up by the house of the Ulwings.</p>

<p>Since the clock had stopped, time ceased to
exist for Anne. A painful trembling of her own
body brought her back to reality. The whole
house trembled. The bell rang in the hall.</p>

<p>Blood rushed to Anne’s benumbed heart.
Her knees gave way as she returned through the
rooms. One after another she closed the doors
behind her, looking back all the time. Near the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
door of the nursery a folded piece of paper lay
on the floor. She picked it up and pressed it
carefully between the glazed wings, as she used
to do, so that they might not rattle when carriages
passed below.</p>

<p>She only realized what she had done when the
door-handle dropped back to its place, when the
door was closed, the door whose rattling would
wake no one any more. Anne sobbed aloud
among the empty walls. The rooms repeated
her sob, one after the other, gently, more and
more gently....</p>

<p>The street door opened below. Dr. Gárdos’
commanding voice was audible on the staircase.
Two men followed him, carrying a stretcher on
their shoulders. Anne came face to face with
them in the corridor. She swayed, as if she had
been hit on the chest, then she seemed quite composed
again. She opened the door and gently
wakened her husband.</p>

<p>The stretcher, with Thomas on it, floated
across the road in the early dawn as over a narrow
blue river. One shore, the habitual one,
was the old house, the other, the strange dark
house, the strange new life in which Anne felt
she had no root.</p>

<p>She passed the gate quickly, with her head
bent. Only in the middle of the road did she
stop and hesitate. She turned back suddenly.</p>

<p>The two pillar-men leaned out under the urns
of the cornice. Their stone eyes turned to her,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
as if they stared straight at her accusingly and
asked a question to which there was no answer.</p>

<p>Florian turned the big old key slowly in the
door. For the last time, the very last time....</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The new inhabitants of the strange, small
lodgings found everything hostile and
bleak in their new surroundings.</p>

<p>An open gas flame whistled in the
narrow anteroom. The neglected doors were
shabby and the dark rooms only remembered
people who had not cared for them and were for
ever moving on.</p>

<p>The first week passed by. Anne did not leave
Thomas’s bedside and still dreaded going to the
window. All this time her soul lead a double
life: one for Thomas, one for the house.</p>

<p>After a sleepless night she could stand it no
longer. She stole gently to the window and
bent hesitatingly, fearfully, forward.</p>

<p>She felt relieved. In the grey morning the old
house still stood intact.... She noticed for the
first time that its yellow walls stood further out
than the other houses and that they obstructed
the road. She was shocked to realize how old
and big it was. Its steep, old-fashioned roof
cast a deep shadow out of which the windows
stared at her with the pitiful gaze of the blind.</p>

<p>While she looked at them one by one, she never
ceased listening to her patient. Suddenly it
seemed to her that Thomas’s breath had become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
weaker. She glided back trembling. Henceforth
this became Anne’s only road. It was a
short road but it embraced Anne’s whole life.</p>

<p>One morning a queer noise roused her from
the sleep of exhaustion. There was silence in
the room, the noise came from the street. She
rose from the armchair in which she spent the
nights and went on tiptoe to the window.</p>

<p>Workmen stood in front of the old house.
Some men rolled tarred poles from a cart. The
front door was open as if gaping for an awful
shriek of agony. A gap had formed between the
tiles of the attics and men walked upon the roof.</p>

<p>Anne covered her eyes. Had she to live
through this? She could not run away. She
would have to see it all....</p>

<p>Thomas started up from a restless dream.</p>

<p>“What is it? What is happening?”</p>

<p>There was no word which could express what
happened there, on the other side of the street,
or if there was one, Anne could not find it.
Without a word, she went back to the bed and
drew her old sweet smile, like a veil, over her
face. She was overwrought, she drew the veil
too hard ... and it broke and covered her no
more.</p>

<p>Thomas reached for her hand. In that instant
he realised the immensity of Anne’s sacrifice.
Till now he had faith in himself and believed
he could attract his wife’s soul to what he
loved. Illness had wrung this hope from him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
and he felt ashamed, his pride suffered, that he
should have been the cause of Anne’s sudden
sacrifice.</p>

<p>His dying eyes looked at her earnestly, with
boundless love. Anne’s back was turned to the
light and while Thomas stroked her hand she
spoke of Ille. She planned....</p>

<p>Next day the post brought a little bag. It
contained wheat ... golden wheat from Ille.
Thomas passed it slowly, pensively, between his
fingers and while the source of life flowed in
poignant contrast between his ghostly, lean
hands, tears came to his eyes.</p>

<p>In these moments, in these days, under the
cover of the worn torn smile Anne’s face became
old.</p>

<p>Out there, the roof of the old house was already
gone and hemmed in between scaffoldings;
like a poor old prisoner, the yellow front was
waiting for its fate. To Anne’s imagining the
house complained behind its wooden cage and
knew that it had been so surrounded only to be
killed.</p>

<p>The pickaxes set to work. The bricks slid
shrieking down a slide from the first floor.
Labourers, Slovak girls, came and went on the
scaffolding and they too carried bricks on hods.</p>

<p>Every passing day saw the house grow smaller.
The labourers tore holes in the walls and left the
rest to crumble down. That was the quickest
way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span></p>

<p>The dull noise went to the marrow, and with
every wall something fell to pieces in Anne’s
heart. It seemed to her that she became feebler
after every crash, that the efforts of generations
collapsed in her soul, great old efforts, with
which the first Ulwings, the ancient unknown
ones, had all carried bricks for the builder&mdash;bricks
for the house.</p>

<p>She thought of her father. He kept the walls
standing. And of Christopher&mdash;he began to
pull the building down. And now the end had
come.</p>

<p>The crevice grew alarmingly in the yellow
wall. By and by the whole front became one
crevice. One could look into the rooms. From
the street people stared in and this affected Anne
as if impertinent, inquisitive strangers spied into
the past of her private life.</p>

<p>Here and there the green wallpaper clung
tenaciously to the ruins. A round black hole
glared in a corner from which the stove pipes
had been torn remorselessly: the tunnel of Christopher’s
stove-fairies. In some places the torn
up floor boards hung in the air and the dark
passages of the demolished chimneys looked as
if a sooty giant finger had been drawn along
the wall.</p>

<p>On the further side, the row of semi-circular
windows in the corridor became visible. The
trees of the back garden stretched their heads<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
and looked out into the street. Then one day
they stood there no longer. When the heavy
waggon drove jerkily with them through the
gaping door, Anne recognized each, one by one.
On the top lay a crippled trunk and the boards
of the cracked, round seat spread from it in
splinters.</p>

<p>Everything went quickly now; even the two
pillar-men lay on their backs on the pavement
of the street. When evening came and the
labourers had gone, Anne snatched a shawl and
ran down the stairs. She wanted to take leave
of the pillar-men. She bent down and looked
into their faces. The light of the street lamp
which used to shine into the green room, lit up
the two stone figures. They looked as if they
had died.</p>

<p>Steps approached from the street corner.
Anne withdrew into the former entrance. Two
men came down the street. The elder stopped;
his voice sounded clear:</p>

<p>“Once this was the house of Ulwing the
builder.”</p>

<p>The younger, indifferent, stepped over the
head of one of the stone figures.</p>

<p>“Ulwing the builder?” Suddenly he looked
interestedly at the mutilated walls.</p>

<p>“Ulwing? ... any relation of the clockmaker
of Buda?”</p>

<p>“His brother.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span></p>

<p>“I never heard that he had any family,” murmured
the younger, continuing his way, “Sebastian
Ulwing did great things for our country.”</p>

<p>Anne looked after them. Was this all that
remained of the Ulwing name? Was the memory
of his work already gone? The heroic death
of Uncle Sebastian, a doubtful legend, was that
all that was remembered?</p>

<p>Men came again. Carriages, life, the noise of
the town.</p>

<p>Anne went back, across the road, towards the
strange house.</p>

<p>That night Thomas became very restless. He
tossed from one side to the other and asked
several times if Anne was there. He did not see
her, though she sat at the side of the bed and
held his hand in hers. She held her head quite
bravely, there was not a tear in her eyes. She
did not want Thomas to read his death sentence
from her face.</p>

<p>In the morning Anne felt her hand tenderly
pressed.</p>

<p>“Are you here?” asked the pallid, dying man.
“All the time I was waiting for you to be here.”</p>

<p>In a few moments Thomas’s features altered
amazingly. A shadow fell over them and Anne
looked round vainly to find out whence it came.
Yet it was there and became darker and darker
in the hollow of his eyes, round his mouth.</p>

<p>“I am going now,” said Thomas, “don’t shake
your head. I know....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span></p>

<p>She could not answer nor could she restrain
her tears any longer.</p>

<p>“Weep, Anne, it will do you good and forgive
me if you can. I did not understand you, that
is what made your life so heavy at my side.”
He shut his eyes and remained a long time without
moving; only his face was now and again
convulsed as if something sobbed within him.
Then he drew Anne’s head to his heart.</p>

<p>“Here ... close, quite close.... This
was yours, yours alone.... Anne....
Anne....” repeated his voice further and
further away, “Anne....”</p>

<p>That was the last word, as if of all the words
of life it were the only one he wanted to take
with him on the long, lone road.</p>

<p>Before night came Thomas Illey was no more.</p>

<p>That night Anne kept vigil between two dead.
Her husband ... and the old house.</p>

<p>When day broke somebody came into the room
and flung his arms around her. Her son.
Thomas’s son.</p>

<p>Leaning on his arm Anne left the strange
house behind Thomas’s coffin. And the younger
boy, fair and blue-eyed held her hand close and
clung to her.</p>

<p>Thomas was borne away. It was his wish to
be buried in Ille. Anne and the two boys went
in a carriage through the town to the station.</p>

<p>It was a warm summer night. The gas lamps
were already alight. Here and there electric<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
globes hung like glowing silver-blue drops from
their wires. Illuminated shops, show windows,
large coffee houses with glaring windows. Servites’
Place, Grenadier’s Street ... and on
what had once been the Grassalkovich corner an
electric clock marked the time.</p>

<p>The carriage turned a corner, the pavements
on both sides swarmed with pushing crowds.
’Buses, carriages, the hum of voices, glaring
posters, people. Many people, everywhere.</p>

<p>Further on there was a block in the traffic.
The scaffoldings of new-built houses encroached
on the pavement. Damp smell of lime mixed
with the summer’s dust. Under the scaffoldings
hurrying figures with drawn-up shoulders. Sudden
shouts. A jet of water sprayed the hot
pavement in a broad sheaf.</p>

<p>A mounted policeman lifted his white-gloved
hand. For an instant everything stopped, then
the crowd became untangled and rolled on like
a stream.</p>

<p>Anne’s eyes passed vaguely over the signs of
the shops. She found no familiar name. The
Jörgs, Münster, Walter, were nowhere. Other
names, other people. And the Ulwings?</p>

<p>A forgotten corner lamp, an old tree surviving
in the row of young trees bordering the streets,
a condemned, quaint old house, uncouthly timid
among the powerful new buildings ... these
might possibly know something of Ulwing the
builder but men knew him no more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span></p>

<p>The carriage reached its destination. It
stopped at the railway station.</p>

<p>In the smoky hall Florian and Mamsell Tini
sat on the luggage. Somewhere a bell was rung
and a voice proclaimed the names of unknown
places that people went to ... lived in.</p>

<p>Anne, standing on the platform, saw a dark
van coupled to the train. They had to wait a
long time ... the train started late. People
came hurrying. Only he who travelled in the
black van to Ille was in no hurry.</p>

<p>The furious bell sounded again.</p>

<p>Anne leaned out of her carriage door though
she wanted to see no more; all was over for her
and far, far away. Her tired aimless look was
suddenly arrested.</p>

<p>Someone came to her, came to her out of the
past ... from far away.</p>

<p>Adam Walter stopped in front of her carriage
and, without a word, uncovered himself. He
stood still there near the line when the train had
gone. He looked long, long after the trail of
smoke.</p>

<p>The long dark night dissolved into dawn and
fields and trees....</p>

<p>Now and then little sentry huts appeared as
if something white had been flashed beside the
rushing windows of the train. The barriers at
the crossings were like outstretched arms. Racing
telegraph poles, signal wires shining like
silver. The shrubs rocked in the wind caused by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
the train and the shadow of the smoke floated
broad over the sunlit cornfields.</p>

<p>Then all was reversed. The train stopped.</p>

<p>People had been waiting for a long time at
the small station of Ille. Blue spots, bright
peasants’ petticoats, shining white chemisettes.
All the round holiday hats were doffed simultaneously
like a flock of black birds.</p>

<p>Bareheaded, dumb, the people of Ille stood
before the wife of Thomas Illey. Hard brown
hands offered themselves and the tearful eyes
looked at her as if they had always known
her.</p>

<p>“God brought you back home to us.” The
deeply furrowed face of an old peasant bent over
her hand.</p>

<p>Those behind gathered round the boys. One
peasant woman stroked George Illey’s arm.</p>

<p>“Oh my sweet soul, you are just like your
father.”</p>

<p>Anne looked round bewildered. She felt
some strange new emotion. The ground she
stood on was the ground of Ille, the trees had
grown from it, the people too, everything was
part of it, her sons, Thomas’s memory....</p>

<p>A deep rustic voice said:</p>

<p>“Our master has come home.”</p>

<p>The crowd opened a way for the metal coffin,
carried by four stalwart youths to a cart. They
placed it on a pile of oak boughs, then all started<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
behind it. At the cross roads the cart turned
towards the chapel. The carriage took the road
through the row of poplars.</p>

<p>Anne’s eyes followed the cart. The wheels
were invisible under the branches hanging down
from it. Rich green life carried death. The
crown of the oak carried Thomas Illey towards
the cemetery.</p>

<p>The bell of the chapel called gently to heaven.
The churches of the villages responded in the distance.
One told the other all over the country,
that the master of Ille had come home.</p>

<p>Along both sides of the road the poplars stood
erect like a guard of honour, full of old traditions.
The carriage turned another corner and
pebbles flew up under the wheels. There, surrounded
by oaks, stood the old manor house of
Ille, and in the cool white-washed hall steps resounded
under the portraits of ancient lords of
Ille.</p>

<p>Anne started wearily, then suddenly stopped,
deeply shocked. As though the house had been
prepared for a gay festival ... it was all
decked with flowers. Her eyes were hurt by the
glare of the bright colours and her pent-up sorrow
moaned within her. She pressed her hands
to her bosom ... the flowers pained her.</p>

<p>“Why did you do it? Why? Just now?”</p>

<p>The old housekeeper left the row of women
servants.</p>

<p>“It was the order of our good master. It was
his will that every flower should be picked when
our mistress came home.”</p>

<p>In Anne’s pale, transparent face the corners
of her eyes and lips rose in silent pain. It was
as though she gazed into a mysterious abyss of
which she had known nothing till this day. Now
she saw Thomas’s soul, now that he had given her
every flower that had not grown on someone
else’s land. He was dead when he gave, but he
gave....</p>

<p>If only one could answer those who are gone;
if only one could speak when speech is no more
possible....</p>

<p>Anne remained alone in a small vaulted room.
Above the couch of many flowers hung the portrait
of Mrs. Christina. The piano, the small
work-table were there too, and everything was in
the same position as it had been in the sunshine
room.</p>

<p>She leaned her brow against the window railing
and from among her old household gods
looked out into the new world. A verdant
breath of the large garden fanned her face. The
trees whispered strange things to each other.</p>

<p>Anne thought of the swing-tree and her gaze
wandered over the garden as if in search of it.
Then she heard something call to her. It became
clearer and clearer. Beyond the trees,
there spoke with quiet distant murmur, a faithful
old voice: the Danube ... the fate of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
Ulwings. The past spoke. This was all that
was left to her; nothing more....</p>

<p>In that instant the tramp of strong young
steps recalled her from the past. Through the
glaring summer sunlight her two sons came
down the gravelled path.</p>

<p>She looked at them and her head rose.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
